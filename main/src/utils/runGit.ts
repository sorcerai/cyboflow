/**
 * Shell-free git (and adjacent CLI) invocation helpers.
 *
 * Every function here uses Node's execFile (not exec/execSync with a shell), so
 * arguments are passed as positional parameters to the binary and are NEVER
 * parsed by a shell. This eliminates the shell-injection class of bugs that the
 * legacy `execSync(\`git ... ${value}\`)` pattern exposes: repo-controlled data
 * (branch names, remote names, refs) reaches these calls on ordinary dashboard
 * refreshes.
 *
 * Shell-freedom alone does NOT close git's own option-injection surface: a
 * branch literally named `--upload-pack=touch /tmp/pwned` is still a valid argv
 * element that git would parse as an option. Two mechanisms defend that:
 *   - {@link END_OF_OPTIONS} — git's own `--end-of-options` marker (git >= 2.24),
 *     placed after the last real flag so every following argv element is forced
 *     into a value position. Prefer this wherever the subcommand supports it.
 *   - {@link assertNotOptionLike} — a hard reject for values that start with `-`,
 *     for the handful of subcommands that predate `--end-of-options` (notably the
 *     trivial 3-arg `git merge-tree`).
 *
 * Use runGit (sync) when the caller is already synchronous (e.g. inside a
 * non-async function or a pre-existing execSync chain). Prefer runGitAsync
 * for any new code path or any async caller. Use runGitCapture when the caller
 * needs stderr as well as stdout (many git commands report progress on stderr).
 *
 * TASK-698: Removed the dead binary-encoding option from RunGitOptions.
 * runGit/runGitAsync always return string — the Buffer branch was unreachable
 * and zero callers used it. If a future caller needs raw Buffer output,
 * add a separate `runGitBinary` helper rather than re-introducing
 * polymorphism here.
