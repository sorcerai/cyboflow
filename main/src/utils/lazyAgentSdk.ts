/**
 * Lazy loader for `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`'s `query`.
 *
 * The SDK entry is a single pre-bundled ~1 MB CJS file costing ~50 ms to parse
 * warm (worse on a cold filesystem cache). Five modules call `query()` and all
 * of them sit on the app-boot import graph (claudeCodeManager via services
 * wiring; vlmJudge, monitorQuery, evalJudgeQuery, pairwiseJudgeQuery via
 * index.ts), so a top-level import anywhere makes every app boot pay that parse
 * before the window shows. Routing every call site through this helper defers
 * the parse to the first real SDK query, where it is imperceptible next to the
 * subprocess spawn.
 *
 * Type-only imports of the SDK remain fine anywhere — they are erased at
 * compile time. Only VALUE imports (`import { query } …`) belong here.
 *
 * Under vitest, `vi.mock('@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk')` intercepts the
 * dynamic import exactly like a static one, so the fakeSdk harness and the
 * per-file mocks keep working unchanged.

/**
 * Tee every SDK message stream so `rate_limit_event` readings reach the

 *
 * WHY HERE and not at the managers' EventRouters: this function is the app's
 * single Claude SDK seam (see the guard rationale below), so one tap covers chat
 * turns, both eval judges, the programmatic monitor, verification agents, the
 * runbook drafter, the VLM judge, the session summariser, and the model
 * catalogue. Attaching per-manager would have missed every one of the
 * non-chat callers, and the interactive substrate cannot help either — its
 * transcript normalizer drops every top-level type except assistant/user.
 *
 * WHY A PROXY and not a wrapping generator: `Query` is an AsyncGenerator that
 * ALSO carries control methods, and `claudeModelCatalogService` feature-detects
 * `supportedModels` / `initializationResult` — replacing the object with a plain
 * generator would silently empty the model catalogue forever, with no error and
 * no failing test. The proxy forwards every property, binding methods to the
 * real target so private-field access resolves.
 *
 * Finalization: the tee is `for await`-based, so `return()`/`throw()` propagate
 * to the underlying generator by construction. That matters — `claudeCodeManager`
 * breaks out of the loop on abort and every judge ends on a deadline, and a
 * swallowed finalization would regress subprocess teardown.
