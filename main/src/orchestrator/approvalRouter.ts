/**
 * ApprovalRouter — singleton that owns the approval request/respond lifecycle.
 *
 * Design invariants (non-negotiable per ROADMAP-001 §5.7 and slice 6):
 *
 * 1. requestApproval co-writes the approvals INSERT and workflow_runs UPDATE
 *    inside a single db.transaction() guarded by `AND status='running'` on
 *    the UPDATE.  If the guarded UPDATE matches 0 rows, the transaction rolls
 *    back (no INSERT, no fold) and the caller re-reads workflow_runs.status to
 *    decide: a run still in 'awaiting_review' means a SIBLING approval is in
 *    flight, so requestApproval WAITS for the next 'approvalDecided' (raced
 *    with a short self-heal timer) and RETRIES — it does NOT throw, which is
 *    what previously caused a deny-storm when the SDK fired parallel tool calls
 *    in one turn. Only a terminal/invalid status (canceled / completed /
 *    failed / missing) throws RunNotRunningError. The single-pending model is
 *    preserved: a sibling never INSERTs until it grabs 'running'. P4: that SAME
 *    transaction also co-writes a blocking permission review_items row (the
 *    unified-inbox fold), so the approval row and the inbox row commit or roll
 *    back together; respond() resolves the folded item idempotently. The fold is
 *    a no-op on a pre-migration-016 DB (table-existence guarded).
 *
 * 2. respond uses a guarded UPDATE `WHERE id=? AND status='awaiting_review'`
 *    and checks info.changes > 0 before writing the allow reply on the socket.
 *    If changes === 0, the run was concurrently canceled — no socket write.
 *
 * 3. Both requestApproval and respond submit their mutations via an
 *    ApprovalRouter-owned per-run p-queue (this.approvalQueues), ensuring
 *    serialization of all approval-mutations for the same run.  This queue
 *    is intentionally separate from RunQueueRegistry's per-run queue: that
 *    queue hosts the long-running runExecutor.execute() task, and re-entering
 *    it from inside a PreToolUse hook would self-deadlock (see
 *    runQueueRegistry.ts §no-recursive-enqueue rule).
 *
 * 4. The deny path mirrors the allow path's workflow_runs transition: a
 *    guarded UPDATE awaiting_review → running. The user denied this specific
 *    tool call, not the entire run, so Claude is free to retry with a
 *    different tool. Each subsequent PreToolUse opens a fresh approval gate.
 *
 * 5. Approvals do NOT auto-expire. A pending approval remains in the queue
 *    until the user decides (approve / reject) or the run is canceled. This
 *    matches the product invariant "workflow pauses until the human triages."
 *
 * Standalone-typecheck invariant: this file must NOT import from 'electron',
 * 'better-sqlite3', or any concrete service in main/src/services/*.
 * All collaborators are injected via the constructor.

   *  2. INSERTs a row into approvals (status = 'pending') + folds a blocking

   *
   * All writes share a single db.transaction() so they are either both
   * committed or both rolled back.
   *
   * Concurrency: if step 1 matches 0 rows the txn rolls back and we re-read
   * the run's status OUTSIDE the txn. If it is 'awaiting_review' a sibling
   * approval is in flight, so this call WAITS (off the queue, so respond() is

   *
   * Returns a Promise<ApprovalDecision> that resolves when respond() is called.
   *
   * @param runId        - workflow_runs.id
   * @param toolName     - The tool name Claude is requesting permission for.
   * @param input        - The tool call's input arguments.
   * @param socketReply  - Closure invoked exactly once by respond() to convey
   *                       the decision back to the caller. Under the SDK
   *                       PreToolUse path this is a no-op (the caller awaits
   *                       the returned promise directly); the INTERACTIVE shell
   *                       transport (handleShellApprovalRequest) uses it to write
   *                       the verdict on the held-open socket — load-bearing,
   *                       must NOT regress.
   * @param source       - Provenance stamped on the folded permission
   *                       review_item (default 'approval'; the interactive shell
   *                       path passes 'approval:interactive'). Optional so every
   *                       existing SDK caller is unchanged.
   * @param onCreated    - Invoked with the minted approvalId the moment the row
   *                       is committed, so a caller that must ADDRESS the
   *                       approval later can. Only the omp-sdk lane needs this:
   *                       its gate hangs up at ~25s and must then mark the ask
   *                       {@link setAwaited}(false), which requires the id. The
   *                       promise this method returns carries only the decision,
   *                       and 'approvalCreated' cannot be correlated back to one
   *                       call without racing a concurrent sibling. Fired inside
   *                       the queue task, before the event: a throw here would
   *                       break the grab, so it is wrapped by the caller-facing
   *                       contract "must not throw".

   * void). Here the requester is gone but THE ASK IS STILL LIVE: the OMP gate's
   * human-decision budget expired, and the human has simply not answered yet.
   *
   * WHY THIS EXISTS. `abandonPendingForRun` settles every pending approval as a
   * system deny, which on the omp-sdk lane means the human is given ~25 seconds
   * to answer before cyboflow answers "no" on their behalf — measured live on
   * 2026-08-19 as 17 approvals, 17 system rejections, zero human verdicts. That
   * is correct for a `preToolUseShellHook` subprocess that DIED (nothing will
   * ever consume the verdict) and wrong for an OMP gate that merely stopped
   * waiting: OMP's 30s extension-handler cap bounds how long the REQUESTER can
   * block, not how long the QUESTION stays worth asking. This method keeps the
   * approvals row `pending`, keeps the in-memory entry so a later `respond()`
   * still resolves it, and keeps the folded review_item in the inbox — the card
   * stays put until a human decides, which is the router's own documented
   * invariant (§5: "Approvals do NOT auto-expire").
   *
   * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY GIVES UP. The single-pending-per-run model is a
   * consequence of run status: `requestApproval`'s guarded UPDATE only INSERTs
   * while the run is 'running', and a pending approval holds it in
   * 'awaiting_review'. Restoring 'running' with a row still pending therefore
   * lets a SECOND approval exist for the same run. That is the intended trade —
   * the alternative is the wedge `abandonPendingForRun` documents, where no
   * approval is ever INSERTed again — and the caller is responsible for not
   * multiplying cards for the SAME call (mcpQueryHandler re-attaches a retry to
   * the orphaned approval rather than opening a new one).
   *
   * Terminal cleanup is unchanged: `clearPendingForRun`'s DB sweep settles any
   * row orphaned this way when the run finally ends, so nothing leaks.

   * hangs up at ~25s and tells the model to retry, and from that moment until
   * the next retry NOBODY is waiting. The row stays pending because the verdict
   * is still collectable (a live smoke on 2026-08-20 had a human decision made
   * ~5 minutes later replay into a retry in a LATER turn and execute), but the
   * queue was still painting it as a halted agent — a red "blocked Nm" badge on
   * a run that had long since moved on.
   *
   * This is the reason there is no expiry sweep here. A TTL was the obvious
   * reaper and it is the wrong tool: short enough to keep the queue tidy is
   * short enough to destroy the cross-turn replay, and long enough to preserve
   * it barely reaps. §5's "approvals do NOT auto-expire" stands; what changes is

   * Writes BOTH halves of the truth in one place — `approvals.awaited` (which

   * different surfaces and disagreeing is worse than either being wrong.
