/**
 * Unit tests for the controller-side draft validation
 * (docs/proposals/lane-runbook-bootstrap.md §8 checks 2–3).
 *
 * Check 3 — "every build/serve command must resolve to a DECLARED package.json
 * script" — is the highest-value guard in the proposal, and most of this file is
 * about it. The reason is §1's diagnosis: the engine used to guess the serve
 * command per run, with no memory, and guessed wrong every single time in
 * production. The setup agent's answer to that was a PROSE rule ("never guess a
 * command"), and prose is not enforcement. This check makes "the agent proposed
 * this command" and "the project documents this command" the same statement.
 *
 * The resolver is deliberately CONSERVATIVE, and the tests pin that direction
 * rather than merely the happy path: a false rejection costs one trip through
 * Verify Setup where a human writes the command, while a false acceptance is an
 * unreviewed command the harness then runs on every verification forever.
