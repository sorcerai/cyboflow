/**
 * THE §5.4 ACCEPTANCE FAILURE-INJECTION MATRIX
 * (docs/proposals/verification-setup-flow.md §5.4), as scripted scenarios.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AND WHY IT IS NOT MORE UNIT TESTS. Every module in
 * `verify/` already has a suite proving its own contract in isolation, and v1 of
 * the proposal proposed "3 consecutive green runs" as the acceptance bar. v2
 * threw that out with a one-line argument worth restating: *three warmed
 * happy-path passes prove none of the guarantees this proposal exists for.* The
 * failures this phase was built to stop are all COMPOSITIONAL — a squatted port
 * that becomes a lane-blocking FAIL because the classifier never saw the
 * preflight; a drifted runbook that still executes because the demotion happened
 * in a store nobody re-read; an install command that reaches a snapshot because
 * one of the two enqueue seams forgot the guard. None of those can fail in a
 * module test, because in a module test the collaborator that would have caught
 * them is a stub.
 *
 * So each row below drives the REAL {@link VerificationScheduler}, the REAL
 * {@link VerificationAgentRunner}, the REAL {@link VerifyRunbookStore} /
 * {@link VerifyCapabilityStore}, and the REAL enqueue seam
 * ({@link prepareVerificationEnqueue}) over a migration-backed in-memory DB. Only
 * the OUTSIDE WORLD is faked, and only at the seams the modules already inject
 * for exactly this purpose: the SDK query, the chromium/port/screen probes, the
 * harness's §7.1 identity probe, and (for the two dependency rows) the `cp`
 * that builds a mirror. Nothing between `enqueue()` and the persisted terminal
 * row is a stub — which is the only way a row can be evidence about the SYSTEM
 * rather than about one module's opinion of its neighbours.
 *
 * ONE ROW IS DELIBERATELY NOT AUTOMATED. §5.4 says "every row is a scripted
 * scenario, runnable unattended EXCEPT the consent row" — the native-screen
 * consent gate moves the user's real pointer, and §4's v1 policy is explicit
 * per-run go-ahead. That row is a `it.todo` naming the decision it is waiting
 * on; what IS asserted here is the contract that actually exists today
 * (observe-only: `requiresDrive` behaviors coerced to `not_testable`, and a
 * capability-less host skipped before any lease is taken).
 *
 * READING A FAILURE HERE. A red row is a claim about the composition, so the
 * useful first question is never "which assertion broke" but "which seam stopped
 * agreeing with its neighbour". The row titles are written to make that
 * answerable: each names the injected fault and the observable §5.4 requires.
