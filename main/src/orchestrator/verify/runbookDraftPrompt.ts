/**
 * The per-round prompt handed to the runbook-drafting agent
 * (docs/proposals/lane-runbook-bootstrap.md §8, §12 steps 4 and 7).
 *
 * Separate from the agent's own markdown (which is its persona and its rules,
 * shared by every deployment) because this is the part that CHANGES between
 * rounds: which modality, whether to adopt a committed runbook or author one,
 * and — the whole reason a second round exists — why the previous attempt's proof
 * failed. §12 step 7 allows exactly two rounds, and the second one is only worth
 * its cost if it is informed; a re-draft with no feedback is the same guess
 * again.
 *
 * PURE — a string function, so what the agent is actually told is assertable.

      '`bun run <script>`, optionally with extra arguments. Not a bare binary (`vite`, `next`), not ' +
      '`npx`, not a `&&` chain, not a command you believe *ought* to work. The harness refuses to run a ' +
      'command the project itself has not written down. Read `package.json` and use what is there.\n' +
      '2. **No dependency-mutating commands.** No install, no rebuild, no browser download. Dependencies ' +
      'are prepared for the verification before your commands run.\n\n' +

      `- \`{ "kind": "${RUNG1_OPERATION_KINDS[0]}", "scriptName": "…", "command": "…" }\` — add a NEW ` +
      'script to the root `package.json`. It will be refused if that script already exists; the harness ' +
      'never overwrites one.\n' +
      `- \`{ "kind": "${RUNG1_OPERATION_KINDS[1]}", "file": "…", "port": 5173, "envVar": "PORT" }\` — make ` +
      'a hardcoded port read an environment variable instead (keeping the number as the fallback). The ' +
      'literal must occur exactly ONCE in that file.\n' +
      `- \`{ "kind": "${RUNG1_OPERATION_KINDS[2]}", "file": "…", "setting": "strictPort" }\` — flip a ` +
      '`strictPort`-style `true` to `false` so a busy port does not fail the launch. It must occur ' +
      'exactly once.\n\n' +
