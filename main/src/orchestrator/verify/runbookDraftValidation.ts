/**
 * CONTROLLER-SIDE validation of a drafted runbook, before anything is written
 * (docs/proposals/lane-runbook-bootstrap.md §8, checks 1–3).
 *
 * The schema check lives in `runbookDraft.parseRunbookDraftResult` (it is part of
 * the output contract). What lives HERE is the pair of semantic checks that ask
 * whether the commands the agent proposed are commands this project actually
 * has:
 *
 *   2. the §7.2 dependency guard, unchanged and shared — a runbook that smuggles
 *      an install through is exactly as dangerous as a composed task that does,
 *      and arguably worse because it is PROVEN and would repeat on every request.
 *   3. every `build`/`serve` command must resolve to a DECLARED `package.json`
 *      script invocation.
 *
 * WHY RULE 3 IS THE HIGHEST-VALUE GUARD IN THE PROPOSAL. §1's diagnosis of the
 * pre-runbook era is that the engine "guesses the environment per-run with no
 * memory and guesses wrong every time" — 0-for-5 in production, on exactly this:
 * the shape of the serve command. The Verify Setup agent's prompt answers that
 * with a prose rule ("never guess a command; read it out of the project"), and
 * prose is not enforcement. This converts it into a mechanical check, and in
 * doing so makes "the agent proposed this command" and "the project documents
 * this command" the same statement. An agent that invents `vite --port 5173` for
 * a project whose script is `dev:web` cannot get past this, and the honest
 * outcome — `NOT-POSSIBLE`, a human designs it in Verify Setup — is exactly what
 * should happen there.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO is understand shell. A chained command
 * (`&&`, `;`, a pipe, a subshell) is REJECTED rather than decomposed: the rule is
 * "this command is a documented script of this project", and a chain is by
 * construction something the project does not document as one unit. A project
 * that needs a chain expresses it as a script, which is both the check passing
 * and the better artifact.
 *
 * PURE — every input is a value the caller already read.
