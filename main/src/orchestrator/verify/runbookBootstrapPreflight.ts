/**
 * The lane runbook-bootstrap PREFLIGHT — the decision made at enqueue time,
 * before any request row exists (docs/proposals/lane-runbook-bootstrap.md §12
 * step 1, §13 phase 2).
 *
 * WHAT IT ANSWERS. "This lane is about to enqueue a verification the §3.2
 * degrade gate is going to skip. Should this run derive and prove a runbook
 * first, or is skipping the honest outcome?" That is deliberately ALL it
 * answers: it is a pure decision over (toggle, task shape, runbook situation),
 * with the acting — claim the stamp, spawn the drafting agent, commit, register,
 * prove, re-enqueue — layered on top in phase 3.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES BEFORE THE ENQUEUE rather than inside the gate. The gate runs
 * after the row is written and the lease taken; by then the lane has a request
 * that is going to be skipped and a `skipped` terminal is the only thing left to
 * write. The bootstrap has to happen while there is still a decision to make —
 * and, critically, before the enqueue key is burned: `findLiveRequestByEnqueueKey`
 * counts a `skipped` terminal as a live dedup hit, so a bootstrap that ran
 * afterwards could not re-fire the lane's own request under the same key.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT INSIDE `enqueueTaskVerification`. Two reasons. The decision has
 * to be unit-testable without a scheduler, a database, or a filesystem — it is
 * the piece whose correctness matters most and whose inputs are the easiest to
 * fake. And the enqueue seam has a hard NEVER-THROWS contract; keeping the
 * decision here, injected, means that contract is enforced at one small
 * boundary rather than spread through a longer function.
 *
 * PHASE 2 STATUS: this module is COMPLETE and WIRED, and the caller does not yet
 * act on what it returns. The point of landing it dark is that a user who turns
 * the toggle on can read the backend log and see exactly what the bootstrap
 * would have done on their project — including, on projects where it declines,
 * WHY — before any version of it is allowed to write to their branch.
