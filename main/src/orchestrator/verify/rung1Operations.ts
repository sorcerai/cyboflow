/**
 * Applying a RUNG-1 operation — the denylist, the target rules, and the three
 * structural edits themselves (docs/proposals/lane-runbook-bootstrap.md §8.1).
 *
 * READ §15A FIRST. This is the one path in the whole feature whose safety claim
 * is REVIEW-BACKED rather than structural. Both adversarial reviews concluded
 * independently that an autonomous edit to an executable config file cannot be
 * made structurally safe — a config file decides what is built and what is
 * served, and no validator short of understanding the project can rule out a
 * change that alters either. The user's decision was to keep rung 1 and accept
 * that, so this module's job is to narrow the blast radius as far as it goes
 * without a human in the loop, and the compensating controls (a separate commit,
 * the artifact, a finding that NAMES the edited file) are the actual guarantee.
 *
 * THE NARROWING, CONCRETELY. Every edit here is performed against a PARSED or
 * UNIQUELY-MATCHED target — never a diff, never a line range, never a regex
 * sweep:
 *
 *   - `add-script` parses `package.json` and adds one key, refusing to overwrite
 *     an existing one.
 *   - `port-from-env` replaces one integer literal, and only when that literal
 *     occurs EXACTLY ONCE in the file.
 *   - `relax-strict-port` flips one boolean literal, and only when the setting
 *     occurs EXACTLY ONCE.
 *
 * AMBIGUITY IS A REJECTION, ALWAYS. Two matches is not "pick the first" — a
 * literal `5173` that appears both in a `server.port` and in a proxy target is
 * a case where the agent's model of the file is demonstrably incomplete, and
 * guessing there is how a machine edit silently repoints a proxy. Every
 * multi-match path below returns an error, which degrades to today's skip.
 *
 * PURE — string and JSON transforms over content the caller supplies. The
 * controller does the reading and the writing, so every rule here is testable
 * against a literal.

 * edit escapes the review surface this rung depends on. A lockfile edit changes
 * what every later install resolves; `.github/` and CI configs change what runs
 * on push, outside this repo's own review; `.claude/` changes agent permissions
 * (the repo's settings file has historically been able to disable the approval
 * gate outright); `scripts/` is executable code a `package.json` script would

 * only one of them — and the repo `.claude/settings.json` is a file whose
 * contents decide whether the approval gate binds at all. `.git/` and `.husky/`
 * were added at the same time: hooks and repo config are executed, which is the
