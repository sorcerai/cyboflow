/**
 * verdictDelivery — wires the VerificationScheduler's `onVerdict` hook to the
 * EXISTING router chokepoints (no new table, no direct UPDATEs). It is the
 * concrete side-effect the P5 scheduler stubbed behind the injected `OnVerdict`
 * callback (see verificationScheduler.ts §"Verdict delivery"). The scheduler
 * itself stays electron/service-free (standalone-typecheck invariant) because
 * this module is INJECTED into it from main/src/index.ts, never imported by it.
 *
 * THREE deliveries (P8b promotes the lane gate from advisory to the visual
 * MERGE-GATE — locked decision #2):
 *
 *  1. ArtifactRouter.mergeScreenshots — ATOMICALLY merges into the SAME
 *     run-scoped 'screenshots' artifact (§5.9): fileNames unioned, verdict banner
 *     latest-wins, and (agent engine) a per-task `TaskVerificationReportEntry`
 *     upserted by (taskRef, requestId). The read-merge-write happens inside the
 *     router's per-project queue, so a concurrent auto-mint scan can never lose
 *     this delivery's reports entry (the pre-§5.9 read-then-create race).
 *
 *  2. MERGE-GATE lane drive (applyMergeGateVerdict — P8b). For a SPRINT run (one
 *     with a batch + lanes), the verdict drives the lane off its `awaiting-verify`
 *     park step: PASS → integrated; FAIL under the 3× cap → back to `implement`
 *     with a bumped attempt (the loopback); FAIL at the cap → `failed`;
 *     low_confidence → advisory pass-through. Threaded with the request's OWN
 *     attempt so a delivery-outbox boot replay never double-bumps the loopback.
 *
 *  3. ReviewItemRouter finding (§5.7). A FAIL / low_confidence / timeout / skipped
 *     terminal raises ONE finding (PASS raises none). A FAIL body now carries the
 *     agent's REPORT (behaviors failed + evidence + feedback), or the build/launch
 *     log excerpt for a verdict-less build failure; non-blocking findings carry the
 *     CONCRETE reason (error_message threaded from the agent path). Every finding
 *     persists a machine-readable (runId, taskRef, attempt, requestId) correlation
 *     so creation is idempotent by requestId (replay-safe) and a later terminal
 *     verdict can SUPERSEDE prior lower-attempt findings for the same lane.
 *
 * SUPERSESSION (§5.7): on EVERY terminal verdict for a lane (incl. PASS), prior
 * UNRESOLVED visual-verify findings for the same (runId, taskRef) at LOWER
 * attempts are resolved through ReviewItemRouter with a supersession note — a
 * recovered lane leaves no stale blocking item, and repeated failures keep only
 * the latest blocker live.
 *
 * Standalone-typecheck invariant: this file imports ONLY the electron-free
 * orchestrator routers + the merge-gate driver + shared types + the narrow
 * DatabaseLike / LoggerLike — no 'electron' / 'better-sqlite3' / services import.
 * EXCEPTION (verifier-transcript capture): `node:fs`'s `existsSync` is the
 * DEFAULT (overridable) `fileExists` seam for the ADVISORY transcript-presence
 * check below — a pure sync stat check, never electron/better-sqlite3, and
 * injected so a test can swap it without touching real disk.

 * when the §3.4 circuit breaker TRIPS — K consecutive env-class failures for one

 * (docs/proposals/verification-setup-flow.md §3.4).
 *
 * It lives HERE, not in the scheduler, for the same reason the verdict delivery
 * does: the scheduler is standalone-typecheck-clean and never touches a router,
 * so the ReviewItemRouter chokepoint is reached only through an injected seam
 * (main/src/index.ts wires this factory into `capabilityFinding`).
 *
 * Deliberately rides the EXISTING visual-verify finding seam — same
 * `source: 'visual-verify'`, same `category: 'visual-regression'`, same
 * `audience: 'human'` — and adds no new finding category. It is NON-BLOCKING by
 * construction: an auto-paused modality must be visible, never a gate. The body
 * states how it recovers, because a suppression a human cannot see the end of is
 * indistinguishable from a permanent outage: the mark self-refreshes on the
 * VerifyCapabilityStore TTL and on any host-capability-generation bump (a probe
 * anywhere observing a changed host fact), and a single healthy outcome clears
 * the counter.
 *
 * FAIL-SOFT: a router error is logged and swallowed. The suppression itself is
