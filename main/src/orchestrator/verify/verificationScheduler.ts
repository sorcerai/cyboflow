/**
 * VerificationScheduler — the main-process singleton that owns the DB-backed
 * verification_requests queue, the ResourceLeasePool (built over the shared
 * `mutex`), and the waterfall drain loop (see docs/proposals/visual-verification-design.md
 * §4 + "The collision story"). It is the producer-side scheduler for the layered
 * visual-verification MVP: lane agents fire a request (INSERT 'queued' + nudge),
 * never block; this scheduler drains them on ITS OWN setImmediate loop, leases the
 * scarce resources a chosen backend needs, captures + judges, then writes a
 * terminal verdict.
 *
 * Singleton lifecycle mirrors SprintLaneStore / TaskChangeRouter (initialize /
 * getInstance / _resetForTesting). Pass `logger` at initialize time from
 * main/src/index.ts — omitting it silently disables diagnostics (CLAUDE.md
 * optional-logger rule).
 *
 * Standalone-typecheck invariant: this file must NOT import from 'electron',
 * 'better-sqlite3', 'fs', or any concrete service in main/src/services/*. The DB
 * is injected as the narrow DatabaseLike, the logger as LoggerLike, the backends
 * as a VerificationBackendRegistry, the judge as a VlmJudge, and the artifacts-dir
 * resolver as a plain function — all renderer-safe shared types or primitives.
 *
 * The collision doctrine in one line: SCARCE RESOURCES SERIALIZE, LANES KEEP
 * FLOWING. If no lease a chosen backend needs is free, the REQUEST stays 'queued'
 * and is retried on the next drain — the lane (a task already on its own
 * RunQueueRegistry PQueue) is never held. nudge() schedules the drain on this
 * scheduler's OWN setImmediate loop, deliberately NOT on RunQueueRegistry
 * (no-recursive-enqueue rule, RunQueueRegistry.ts:9-13 — the request arrives FROM
 * a task already on that concurrency:1 queue, so enqueuing there self-deadlocks).

   * Block until `requestId` settles, then hand back its verdict inline
   * (docs/proposals/verification-setup-flow.md §5.2 seam 2).
   *
   * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Every other consumer of this queue is
   * fire-and-continue, and that is correct FOR THEM: a sprint lane enqueues,
   * parks at `awaiting-verify`, and the verdict is DRIVEN onto it later by the
   * merge gate — the lane agent's turn has already ended, so there is nobody left
   * to hand a verdict to. The phase-2 setup flow is the first caller with the
   * opposite shape: its whole job is "derive → PROVE BY RUNNING → diagnose →
   * adjust → re-prove", and every one of those arrows needs the outcome of the
   * previous step IN THE SAME TURN. Without this seam the flow's only options are
   * to poll the DB itself (it has no DB access) or to end its turn and hope
   * something resumes it (nothing would) — which is exactly why §5.2 names the
   * "wait-for-verdict seam, bounded, with the verdict surfaced inline" as a thing
   * that must be BUILT rather than assumed.
   *
   * POLLING THE ROW, NOT SUBSCRIBING TO THE EVENT. `verificationEvents` looks like
   * the natural wake source, but it is a fire-once in-process emit: a request that
   * terminalized between the caller's enqueue and its await (a fast skip — an
   * unsupported modality, a suppressed capability, an exhausted queue-age) has
   * ALREADY emitted, and a subscriber would then wait out the full deadline for an
   * event that can never fire again. Boot recovery has the same shape across a
   * restart. The ROW is the durable record of the outcome; re-reading it is
   * correct whether the terminal happened a second ago or before this call
   * existed, and a once-a-second read of one indexed row is not a cost worth
   * optimizing against that.
   *
   * BOUNDED, AND HONEST ABOUT THE BOUND. On expiry the request's CURRENT status is
   * returned as-is (queued/leased/running) with {@link AWAIT_TERMINAL_TIMEOUT_MESSAGE}
   * — the caller stopped waiting, the request did not stop running, and the two
   * must not be conflated. Nothing is canceled: the request keeps draining and its
   * verdict still lands on the artifact + review queue through the normal delivery
   * path, so a proof that merely outran a caller's patience is not lost.
   *
   * `pollIntervalMs` exists so a test can drive the loop without a real second per
   * iteration; production callers take the default. The sleep is clamped to the
   * remaining budget, so the deadline is honored to within one DB read rather than
   * overshot by up to a full interval. The deadline itself is measured on the
   * scheduler's INJECTED clock (`deps.now`) — the same one the drain ages rows on
   * — so a test that freezes the clock freezes this deadline with it.

   * §5.2 seam 3, ENQUEUE half — resolve the PROVEN runbook revision a request

   * none. Public because BOTH enqueue entry points (the MCP handler and the

   * the store is injected HERE, not into either of them; the shared merge +
   * validation logic that consumes this lives in one place too
   * (`enqueueFromTask.prepareVerificationEnqueue`).
   *
   * WHY THE PROBE PATH IS THE RUN'S WORKTREE FIRST. `status()` re-validates the
   * proof against the portable file at a specific tree, and the tree that
   * matters is the one the requesting run is actually changing — a run whose
   * branch edited (or has not yet merged) the runbook must be judged by ITS
   * copy, not by the project's main checkout. That is the same worktree-first
   * ladder `verifyConfigLoader` walks, for the same reason. The project path is
   * the fallback for a run with no worktree; with neither, there is nothing to
   * probe and the answer is `null` (no pin ⇒ the §3.2 degrade gate decides).
   *
   * A null answer is NEVER an error path — it is "this request executes
   * unpinned", which for a build/serve task means the degrade gate skips it with
   * a setup CTA, and for a degenerate pre-live task means nothing changes at
   * all.

   * capability ledger, the injected runbook-status thunk, and — for
   * `native-screen` only — the injected host-capability probe; the sole write is
   * the ledger's `markUnsupported`).
   *
   *  1. UNSUPPORTED MODALITY (§3.3/§4). `mobile` has no executable path on the
   *     agent engine — the agent path never consults `verify_type` at all
   *     (dispatch keys solely on the run's chain stamp), so a `mobile-flow`
   *     request would otherwise be deployed and left to fail organically ten
   *     minutes later with an unhelpful message. This states the fact up front
   *     AND records it in the ledger, so the next request for the same
   *     (project, modality) short-circuits at gate 2 without even re-deriving it.
   *
   *     `native-screen` is no longer a HARD skip: phase 1 gave it an executable
   *     observe-only path (driver `native-screenshot`/`attest window`, the
   *     runner's drive-unsupported coercion), so the question became a HOST
   *     question — can this machine capture the screen at all — and it is
   *     answered by the injected {@link VerificationSchedulerDeps.nativeCaptureProbe}
   *     (§4: the retired `peekabooBackend.healthCheck()` both-grants probe).
   *     True ⇒ proceed; false ⇒ the same unsupported skip carrying the
   *     actionable grant-pair detail; ABSENT ⇒ the phase-0 answer unchanged
   *     (unprobed is not capable). A probe that throws is treated as false —
   *     the contract says never-throws, and a broken probe must not fail OPEN
   *     onto the user's live screen.
   *
   *     This gate is why the method is async: the probe is I/O (it shells the
   *     peekaboo binary), and it must run BEFORE any lease is taken so a
   *     capability-less host never holds the screen lease even momentarily.
   *
   *  2. ACTIVE SUPPRESSION (§3.3/§3.4). The ledger says this (project, modality)
   *     is `'unsupported'` or breaker-`'suppressed'` AND the mark has not
   *     self-refreshed (TTL / host-generation — see VerifyCapabilityStore).
   *
   *  3. DEGRADE PATH (§3.2). The request needs an ENVIRONMENT derived for it —
   *     it has a build step or a serve step — and there is no PROVEN runbook for
   *     the modality IN THE TREE THIS REQUEST WOULD EXECUTE IN (the run's
   *     worktree; see the probe-path note on
   *     {@link VerificationSchedulerDeps.runbookStatus}). This deliberately
   *     RETIRES per-run guessing for
   *     build/serve tasks: §1's whole diagnosis is that the agent engine "guesses
   *     per-run with no memory and guesses wrong every time" (0-for-5 in
   *     production; wrong serve form, colliding singletons, wrong ABI, blown
   *     deadline), so continuing to guess buys nothing but a burned deadline and
   *     a lane charged for someone else's port. A DEGENERATE task — a bare
   *     pre-live `target` with no build and no serve — is exempt: pointing a
   *     driver at an already-live URL derives no environment at all, and it is
   *     the ONLY shape that has ever actually passed in production. A

  /**
   * Settle ONE agent runner result: classify it (§3.1), write the terminal with

   * capability ledger (§3.4).
   *
   * THE CONVERSION AND ITS ONE GUARD RAIL. A `'failed'` whose classification is
   * `'env'` is CONVERTED to `'skipped'`, because a merge-gate FAIL charges the
   * lane's implement-retry budget and sends an agent to "fix" working code
   * because a port was taken. The conversion is safe ONLY because
   * `classifyVerificationFailure` reaches `'env'` exclusively on HARNESS-derived
   * evidence — a failed preflight check, a squatter port probe, instance-lock
   * contention. It never converts on model prose: a `build_failed` the agent
   * wrote with no harness corroboration stays `'ambiguous'` and stays BLOCKING.
   * That asymmetry is the whole §3.1 argument — `skipped` ADVANCES the lane
   * (mergeGateLaneAdvance), so a deliverable defect misclassified as env ships
   * broken code silently, while a false `'ambiguous'` is merely annoying.
   *
   * THE MIRROR CONVERSION, AND WHY IT IS HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE. The rule above
   * has a dual that used to go unenforced: a `'skipped'` that came back from a
   * session which ACTUALLY DEPLOYED and whose failure nothing could attribute
   * (`'ambiguous'`) is a lane ADVANCING on a verification that produced no
   * verdict — the same silent-ship hazard as a misclassified `'env'`, arriving
   * from the other direction. Such a result is converted to `'failed'` (see
   * {@link isUnprovenAdvancingSkip} for the two carve-outs). This is the ONE
   * chokepoint for that invariant: every agent terminal in the engine funnels
   * through this method, so a future runner path that forgets the rule is caught
   * without scattering the same check across every return site. The runner still
   * maps its own statuses honestly at source — this is a backstop, and a warn
   * log fires whenever it has anything to do.
   *
   * LEDGER FEEDBACK runs AFTER the terminal write (never before — the write is
   * cancel-guarded and is the load-bearing act): an env-class terminal counts
   * toward the §3.4 breaker; a pass or a DELIVERABLE-attributed failure is a
   * healthy outcome that resets it (the environment demonstrably worked — it
   * built, served, drove, and judged); `'ambiguous'` and every timeout touch
   * NEITHER, because a signal we could not attribute must not silently suppress a
   * modality (nor silently clear a real suppression).
   *
   * PHASE 2 adds the ENGINE-ENFORCED PROOF (§5.3) at the end: a `setup_proof`
   * request that reached `'passed'` while carrying a pin is the ONLY transition
   * into a `'proven'` runbook. See {@link recordRunbookProof}.

   * §3.1 GATE INTEGRITY — is this an advancing skip that NOTHING corroborated?
   * True for a result that (a) actually DEPLOYED an SDK session, (b) came back
   * `'skipped'`, and (c) classified `'ambiguous'`; the caller converts those to
   * a blocking `'failed'`.
   *
   * The three conditions together describe the one dangerous shape: a session
   * ran, produced no attributable failure, and would nonetheless ADVANCE the
   * lane at the merge gate (mergeGateLaneAdvance). Every SAFE skip is excluded
   * by construction rather than by exception — a pre-deploy skip is
   * `deployed:false` (preflight, pin rejection, unresolvable agent, failed
   * provisioning), and a harness-corroborated one classifies `'env'`, which the
   * classifier only ever reaches on harness-derived evidence.
   *
   * TWO CARVE-OUTS, both documented rather than inferred:
   *
   *  1. A CONNECT-LEVEL TRANSPORT failure
   *     ({@link VerificationAgentRunResult.transportFailure}) — the SDK layer
   *     threw and the session had accumulated NO transcript, so the agent never
   *     got a turn. Blocking would turn every API outage into a lane-blocking
   *     FAIL that loops implement agents against code the harness never
   *     examined. The runner narrows the flag to that empty-session shape on
   *     purpose (round-3 finding 4): "our code raised it" was not enough, since
   *     an agent holding `Bash` can kill its own SDK process, and every
   *     MID-SESSION transport failure is now mapped to a blocking `'failed'` at
   *     source rather than arriving here wearing this flag.
   *  2. The §5.7 UNATTRIBUTABLE FALLBACK — a `build_failed`/`launch_failed`
   *     reported while provisioning ran in the DIRTY live worktree. That skip is
   *     the proposal's explicit carve-out: in a worktree carrying every sibling
   *     lane's half-finished edits, a build failure genuinely cannot be charged
   *     to this lane's deliverable, so it fails open on purpose. The pairing is
   *     load-bearing — the same outcomes in SNAPSHOT mode are a blocking
   *     `'failed'` (mapReportToResult) and must stay one.

   * The §5.3 ENGINE-ENFORCED PROOF: flip the pinned machine-local runbook record
   * to `'proven'` because a `setup_proof` request just PASSED through the real
   * verification path — detached snapshot, prepared deps, real boot, real
   * screenshot, real attestation floor.
   *
   * THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT THE AGENT CANNOT DO THIS. §1's diagnosis of the
   * `.cyboflow/verify.json` era is that a config which is merely WRITTEN earns
   * nothing; §5's answer is "derive → PROVE by running → persist". If the setup
   * flow could call `markProven` itself, "proven" would decay back into "an
   * agent said so" — the exact failure mode being fixed. So the only caller is
   * here, on the engine's own terminal path, gated on a status the engine
   * computed.
   *
   * The proof provenance recorded is §5.3's list: the sha actually verified, the
   * portable hash and local version that were pinned, a compact preflight
   * summary (what the host looked like when it passed), the timestamp, and the
   * request id that produced it — enough for a human reading a later demotion to
   * see what changed.
   *
   * A PROOF FROM THE DIRTY FALLBACK PROVES NOTHING EITHER (round-3 finding 2).
   * A NULL `snapshot_sha` means the sha capture failed and the runner executed
   * in the live shared worktree — every sibling lane's half-finished edits
   * included. §5.3 is explicit that "proof runs in the verifier's environment
   * class (detached snapshot + prepared deps) ... a proof obtained in
   * environment X asserted about environment Y is not a proof", and the
   * provenance blob has nowhere to record a sha that does not exist. Promotion
   * is refused and the record stays a draft: the setup flow re-proves once a sha
   * can be captured, which is a bad day rather than a runbook wearing a green
   * badge it never earned.
   *
   * A REQUEST WITHOUT A PIN PROVES NOTHING. A setup-proof run that carried no
   * `runbook_hash` verified *something*, but nothing content-addressed, so there
   * is no record it could be attesting to; it is logged and dropped.
   *
   * CAS FAILURE IS A WARN, NEVER A VERDICT CHANGE. `markProven` matches on BOTH
   * the hash and the version, so a `registerDraft` that landed between this
   * run's enqueue and its terminal rejects the flip — correctly: the proof
   * attests to content the record no longer holds. The verification itself still
   * passed and is written as such; only the promotion is declined, and the setup
   * flow re-proves against the newer revision.

   *   - the request carries no htmlPath (empty after trim): there is nothing to serve.
   *   - the request already declares a running `url`: the agent pointed at a live
   *     server, so we capture that url directly and NEVER shadow it with a static serve.
   *   - the request declares a dev server (non-empty `start`): a STARTABLE deliverable
   *     is S2's job (maybeSpawnDevServer stands it up on a leased port); statically
   *     serving the UNBUILT source html would be wrong. inputDeclaresDevServer is the
   *     SAME signal the dev-server selection gate keys off, so the two seams are
   *     mutually exclusive by construction (runChosen also skips S9 when a dev server
   *     was already spawned).
   *   - the resolver returns null / THROWS: the html could not be worktree-resolved or
   *     does not exist. Fail-soft (debug log) to the raw-htmlPath capture — the rung-0
   *     backend's own file:// module-block diagnostic breadcrumb explains the resulting
   *     blank styled shell to a human.
   *   - the provider.spawn THROWS (bind failure / abort mid-listen): warn + return
   *     null. A static-serve failure must NEVER wedge the request — capturing the raw
   *     htmlPath (blank though it may render) is strictly better than a fabricated FAIL,
   *     and the same file:// diagnostic breadcrumb covers the confusion.
   *
   * The confining static root rides `resolvedContext` (the matched verify.json
   * deliverable's explicit `staticRoot`, when it declares one) rather than the request
   * input — staticRoot is a serve-time concern, not an input field. The resolver
   * defaults it to dirname(html) when absent.
