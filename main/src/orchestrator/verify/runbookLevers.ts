/**
 * runbookLevers — turning the runbook's declared isolation levers into real
 * environment variables for the verification agent's build and serve steps.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `levers` (docs/proposals/verification-setup-flow.md §4) is a
 * set of NAMES: the runbook says "my serve command reads the port from `PORT`",
 * and the harness — the only party that knows the request-scoped VALUES, since
 * the port is leased and the nonce is minted per request — binds them. Until
 * this module, only the harness's own `VERIFY_*` vars were exported and
 * `levers.portEnv` was parsed, hashed and documented while being read by
 * nothing. That left the two facts a web verification actually turns on — does
 * the served surface bind the LEASED port, and does it carry THIS request's
 * attestation nonce — to whatever the verification agent inferred from the
 * runbook's free-text `notes`.
 *
 * That inference is not reproducible, and the failure mode is the expensive
 * direction. Observed live on 2026-08-20: two runs over the same project shape,
 * one agent improvised both bindings and PROVED the runbook, the next replayed
 * it closer to verbatim and failed — so the runbook that got marked proven was
 * one that only works when the agent embellishes it. Exporting the declared
 * levers moves both facts from agent judgment to harness guarantee, which is
 * what `port-from-env` (rung 1) was designed around in the first place.
 *
 * TWO HARD RULES, both because a runbook is machine-authored:
 *
 *   1. A lever may never SHADOW a variable the harness owns. The caller passes
 *      the already-built base env and anything keyed there wins, so a runbook
 *      declaring `portEnv: "VERIFY_PORT"` is a correct no-op rather than a
 *      chance to rewrite the harness's own contract.
 *   2. A name that is not a plain uppercase identifier, or that names part of
 *      the process's execution environment, is DROPPED rather than exported.
 *      `PATH`, `NODE_OPTIONS` and `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` are not configuration
 *      — a declaration that binds one of them is code execution wearing a
 *      lever's name, and the agent that wrote it is the untrusted party here.
 *
 * Dropping is silent by design at this seam (it returns only the additions);
 * the caller logs what it applied, and a lever that fails to take effect
 * surfaces as an honest attestation failure rather than a pass.
