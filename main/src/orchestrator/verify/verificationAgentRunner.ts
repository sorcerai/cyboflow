/**
 * VerificationAgentRunner — deploys the workflow-defined `visual-verify` agent
 * for ONE verification request (docs/proposals/verification-agent-redesign.md
 * §5.4). It is the replacement for the capture-backend + VLM-judge core: instead
 * of the scheduler capturing a screenshot and a VLM judging it, the runner hands
 * a provisioned environment to a single Claude SDK session that BUILDS, SERVES,
 * DRIVES, and JUDGES a composed `VerificationTaskV1` itself, returning a
 * structured `VerificationReportV1`.
 *
 * Electron-free by construction (mirrors the backends / vlmJudge): every
 * side-effecting collaborator is INJECTED — the SDK boundary (`query`), the
 * effective-agent + model resolvers, snapshot provisioning, git checks, fs
 * probes, and the driver-teardown seams all have real defaults but are faked in
 * the unit test, so the module under test imports NO `@anthropic-ai/*` SDK,
 * `electron`, or `better-sqlite3`. The scheduler owns the leases, the per-request
 * deadline, the budget, and persisting the terminal status + `report_json`; this
 * module owns steps 1-6 of §5.4 (resolve → provision → deploy → validate →
 * mutation-check → teardown) and returns the mapped verdict.
 *
 * Provider dispatch (§5.4 step 1): the resolved agent's runtime picks the query
 * seam. An explicit `runtime: 'codex-sdk'` pin — or an unpinned agent inheriting a
 * Codex-provider run — routes to the injected `codexQuery`; a CLAUDE runtime
 * routes to the Claude `query`. On the Claude branch model resolution is
 * Claude-namespace-only (a pinned alias → concrete, else the Claude-provider run
 * model, else a validated Claude default). On the Codex branch the model is
 * `agent.providerModel` (normalized `providerModel ?? codexModel` upstream by
 * effectiveAgents, so either field reads the same value), else the
 * Codex-provider run model, else the account default the query resolves.
 *
 * ANY non-Claude provider with no wired query seam — Codex without `codexQuery`,
 * and every provider that has no verify seam at all (OMP today: its T3 tier is
 * deliberately a later phase) — maps to the fail-open `skipped` bucket with an
 * actionable message. Never a silent Claude fallback: a verifier that quietly
 * ran on the wrong provider would report a verdict nobody asked for.

against its expected result — then return ONE structured report.

Environment (already set for your Bash tool):
- VERIFY_ARTIFACTS_DIR — write every screenshot here (bare filenames, no subdirs).
- VERIFY_DRIVER — a CLI you drive the headless browser with. Subcommands:
    "$VERIFY_DRIVER" serve '<command>'                    # starts the serve/app, detached
    "$VERIFY_DRIVER" goto <url>
    "$VERIFY_DRIVER" click <selector>

    "$VERIFY_DRIVER" screenshot <name> [--viewport WxH]   # writes to VERIFY_ARTIFACTS_DIR

- VERIFY_PORT — when present, bind your dev/preview server to THIS port (the task's
  serve command references it). When absent, the task points at an already-live target.
- VERIFY_ATTEST_NONCE — a per-request secret. It is what makes an attestation mean
  something: the surface must hand this exact value back (in the attest http
  response body, or in the attest dom element's text / data-verify-nonce
  attribute) when the HARNESS asks it, after you finish. A port answering, or a
  page rendering, proves nothing on its own — a stale server or the user's own
  running app answers too. Your job is to make the deliverable's serve step carry
  the nonce, not to report on it: you hold this value yourself, so you repeating
  it back could never prove anything.
- VERIFY_MODALITY — "web" | "cdp-app" | "native-screen" | "mobile".
- CDP-attach mode — when the task's serve has "attach": "cdp", its serve command
  launches the deliverable APP ITSELF exposing a DevTools endpoint on
  VERIFY_DRIVER_PORT (e.g. --remote-debugging-port="$VERIFY_DRIVER_PORT"). Start it
  the same way ("$VERIFY_DRIVER" serve '<that command>'), wait for the app window to
  be up, then drive with the SAME driver subcommands — the driver attaches to the
  app's own web-view (no separate browser, and usually no goto: the app window is
  already the surface under test).

STARTING THE SERVE/APP — AND LEAVING IT RUNNING:
- Start the task's serve command (or, in CDP-attach mode, the app itself) with
    "$VERIFY_DRIVER" serve '<the task's serve command, with \${PORT} substituted>'
  It returns immediately, having started the command detached and recorded it for
  the harness. You then poll readiness exactly as before; its output is captured at
  "$VERIFY_ARTIFACTS_DIR/.driver/serve.log" (tail that for a launch_failed excerpt).
  Do NOT background the command yourself with & or nohup.
- THE SERVE COMMAND MUST BE THE TASK'S, EXACTLY. Pass the task's serve.cmd string
  verbatim; substituting \${PORT} with the value of $VERIFY_PORT is the ONLY edit
  allowed. The harness binds the port that answers the attestation to the process
  group this command started, and reads that group's command line back from the OS:
  a substitute command, a wrapper script, a hand-rolled background job, a serve
  started outside "$VERIFY_DRIVER" serve, or a second serve replacing the first all
  fail identity binding, and an unbound surface FAILS the task exactly like an
  unattested one. Serving something else that echoes the nonce proves nothing —
  the nonce is in YOUR environment, so anything you start can repeat it.
- WHEN YOU FINISH, LEAVE EVERYTHING RUNNING. Do not kill the serve, do not kill the
  app, do not run "$VERIFY_DRIVER" stop. The harness verifies the surface's identity
  against the LIVE app after you finish, then tears everything down itself. A surface
  you shut down cannot be attested and the task will FAIL.

ATTESTATION (the harness proves identity; you cannot):
- Whenever the task carries an "attestation" object, the HARNESS runs that channel
  itself — after your session ends, against the still-live surface, before teardown.
  Nothing you write anywhere, including under VERIFY_ARTIFACTS_DIR, counts as proof:
  a file in your own working space proves only that you can write files. A pass the
  harness cannot independently attest is rejected as unproven, whatever your
  screenshots or your report say.
- The attest subcommands are SELF-CHECK aids, and worth running: kind "http-endpoint"
  → attest http <urlPath>; "dom-marker" → attest dom <selector>; "cdp-token" →
  attest cdp <expression> <expected>; "window-identity" → attest window
  <titlePattern>. A failure tells you your serve step is wrong (a stale process, the
  user's own app, a missing marker route) while you can still fix it and re-serve —
  which is exactly when that information is useful. Running one is never what makes
  the attestation count, and skipping one never makes it fail.
- You may echo what you saw in the report's optional "attestation" field
  ({ "verified": bool, "kind": "...", "detail": "..." }) — that is for humans reading
  the verdict; it is never treated as proof.

NATIVE-SCREEN IS OBSERVE-ONLY:
- When VERIFY_MODALITY is "native-screen" the goto/click/type/screenshot commands are
  REFUSED (driving a native surface has no supported path yet). Use
  native-screenshot to capture and attest window to prove identity. Any behavior you
  cannot exercise without driving MUST be reported "not_testable" — never guessed.

 * a DETACHED snapshot at the task's sha, so the runbook is unresolvable from
 * inside it in both directions — an uncommitted runbook is invisible there, a
 * committed one is absent from every branch cut before it. v1 said "read it live
 * at compose time", which breaks attribution the other way: revision-B commands
 * executing against revision-A code yield a verdict attesting to a hybrid state
 * NO REVISION EVER CONTAINED. So the content is pinned at enqueue and re-checked
 * here. A verdict is a claim about a specific tree; a verdict produced by
 * commands from a different tree is not a weaker claim, it is a false one.
 *
 * CONTENT EQUALITY IS NOT THE WHOLE CHECK, because a record carries two facts a
 * hash cannot: its STATUS and its VERSION, and each matters to exactly one of
 * the two request kinds.
 *
 *  - An ORDINARY request additionally requires `status === 'proven'`. The §3.2
 *    degrade gate already refused to enqueue an unproven build/serve task, so a
 *    record that is `'unproven-draft'` BY THE TIME THE RUNNER LOOKS was demoted
 *    in the window between enqueue and deploy — a real drift signal (an edited
 *    dev script, a moved host fingerprint) that the store recorded and this
 *    request would otherwise execute straight past. Resolving by hash alone
 *    cannot see it: the demotion changes the row's status, never its content
 *    address.
 *  - A SETUP-PROOF request instead requires `version === localVersion`, and
 *    deliberately does NOT require `'proven'` — proving the draft is the entire
 *    point, so a proven-status requirement would deadlock the bootstrap. The
 *    version equality that would be wrong for an ordinary request (see
 *    {@link VerificationAgentRequest.runbookLocalVersion}) is exactly right
 *    here: the flow registered a draft and immediately asked for a proof OF
 *    THAT draft, so a `registerDraft` landing mid-flight means the proof about
 *    to be produced would be recorded against content the record no longer
 *    holds. `markProven`'s own CAS would decline the flip afterwards anyway —
 *    rejecting here just declines it BEFORE spending a deployment on a proof
 *    that could never be recorded.
 *
 * Both rejections are env-class by construction at the call site (a status/
 * version read is a harness fact, never model prose): a demotion race or a
 * re-registration is host/state drift, not a defect in the deliverable, and
 * re-running the lane's implement agent could not fix either.
 *
 * Returns the mismatch DETAIL rather than a bare boolean so the rejection can
 * name what actually differs — the caller puts it on the request row, where it
 * is the only thing a human has to work from.

 * Nothing else is normalized: a different command, a wrapper, or a `$VERIFY_PORT`
 * spelling the contract does not sanction all fail.
 *
 * CONTAINS, not equals, because the leader is `sh -c '<cmd>'` — the recorded
 * command line always carries a prefix this function must tolerate. The residual
 * that buys is honest and worth stating: an agent that starts
 * `sh -c 'echo <pinned cmd>; <something else>'` satisfies this check, and only
 * the port-owner binding then stands between it and a forged surface. Closing

/**
 * BIND THE PROBED SURFACE TO THE PINNED SERVE COMMAND (round-3 finding 3).
 *
 * THE HOLE THIS CLOSES. Moving attestation harness-side (`harnessAttestation.ts`)
 * proved that SOMETHING on the probed port knows this request's nonce. It did not
 * prove that something is the deliverable, and the gap is reachable: the driver's
 * `serve` command runs WHATEVER string the agent passes, and the agent holds
 * `VERIFY_ATTEST_NONCE` in its own environment. One `serve 'python3 -m http.server
 * ... <a page echoing $VERIFY_ATTEST_NONCE>'` produces a surface the harness then
 * attests, honestly, as carrying the nonce — a green verdict about a page the
 * deliverable never rendered. The nonce authenticates a SECRET, and the agent is
 * inside the trust boundary of that secret.
 *
 * WHY KERNEL TRUTH IS THE ONLY WAY OUT. Every artifact the agent could show us —
 * a log, a pid file, an attest record — is writable by the same Bash that would
 * be doing the forging. What the agent cannot author is the OS's own answer to
 * "who holds this socket" and "what is that process running". So the binding
 * spends two `exec`s on exactly those two questions and trusts nothing else:
 *
 *  1. `.driver/serve.pid` — the CLAIM. Read first, believed about nothing. A
 *     forged value can only make step 2 fail (the kernel will name a different
 *     group), which is the safe direction; that asymmetry is why the file may
 *     keep living in agent-writable space at all.
 *  2. PORT-OWNER BINDING. The pid the kernel says is LISTENING on the probed
 *     port must be in the process GROUP the pid file names. The driver spawns
 *     `serve` detached, so the leader's pgid equals its pid and every child it
 *     forks inherits it — which is what makes a group the right unit (a dev
 *     server is a shell wrapping a node wrapping a bundler, and the listener is
 *     usually the grandchild). A fake responder cannot be in that group without
 *     having been started by that command, and it cannot own the port the real
 *     serve holds.
 *  3. COMMAND BINDING. The recorded leader's command line must carry the task's
 *     pinned `serve.cmd` (which `checkRunbookPin` already tied to the proven
 *     runbook upstream). Step 2 alone proves the port belongs to the group the
 *     driver recorded; this proves that group is running the command the task
 *     declared, rather than whatever else the agent asked the driver to start.
 *
 * NEVER THROWS. Every probe rejection folds into a `bound: false` for the same
 * reason `performHarnessAttestation` never throws: an escaping error would land
 * in the runner's outer catch, which returns a fail-open `'skipped'` — the lane
 * ADVANCING on precisely the unproven pass this function exists to block. An
 * unanswerable probe is an unbound surface, not an exception.
