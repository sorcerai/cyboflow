 * The carve-out that keeps a delivered session's FINDINGS out of both archive

 * so it drops straight into either sweep's WHERE clause.
 *
 * Archiving a session dismisses its pending review items because they can no
 * longer be actioned — a permission prompt or a gate on a session that is gone
 * has nothing to resume. A FINDING is different: it describes code, and when the
 * session's work was DELIVERED (see DELIVERED_RUN_OUTCOMES) that code is now in
 * the tree, so the finding still applies and is exactly the fuel the Insights
 * compounding surface is meant to offer. Sweeping it was silently destroying
 * every finding a merge produced — the merge dialog archives the session
 * immediately after a successful merge, so the finding never outlived its run.
 *
 * Delivery is read from the run itself OR any sibling run in the same session:
 * a session's flow run may carry the 'merged' stamp while the quick run that
 * filed the finding carries none.
 *
 * SQL 3VL, twice, both load-bearing. `outcome` is NULL for every in-flight run,
 * and a bare `r.outcome IN (...)` would yield NULL, making the enclosing
 * `NOT (TRUE AND NULL)` evaluate to NULL — which is not TRUE, so the row falls
 * out of the sweep and the finding is preserved on a session that delivered
 * nothing. COALESCE to '' (never a member) forces the honest FALSE. The EXISTS
 * needs no such guard: it is TRUE/FALSE by construction, and a NULL
 * `r.session_id` simply matches nothing, correctly falling back to the run's
 * own outcome.

 * outcome". This sweep stamps the obvious correspondences so historic and
 * crash-recovered rows aggregate correctly.
 *
 * DELIBERATE EXCLUSION — status='completed' rows are NOT touched. A completed
 * run with outcome IS NULL legitimately means "awaiting a close-out decision"
 * (the human has not yet chosen merge / PR / dismiss). Stamping it would erase
 * that pending state and corrupt the awaiting-decision view. Only the two
 * states whose outcome is unambiguous from status alone — 'failed' and
 * 'canceled' — are backfilled.
 *
 * Same guard discipline + single-transaction style as

 *     `outcome IS NULL`, or it would match ~zero prod rows.
 *  2. Any straggler seam that force-fails with the sentinel but skips the outcome.
 *
 * `error_message='app_restart'` is an exact sentinel written by ONLY the three
 * boot-recovery seams (recoverActiveStateOrphans, approvalRouter, questionRouter);
 * a genuine agent failure carries the SDK error text, never that literal — so
 * reinterpreting `outcome='failed'` here is safe and never steals a real failure.
 * Idempotent (re-running is a no-op once every sentinel row is 'interrupted').

 * WHY A BOOT SWEEP AND NOT ANOTHER SEAM CALL.
 * `rollupRunUsage` is wired to exactly ONE place — runExecutor's
 * onLifecycleTransition, for the 'drained' / 'failed' / 'canceled' phases. But a
 * run reaches a terminal STATUS from roughly eight writers: cancelRunHandler,
 * cancelAndRestartHandler, questionRouter, trpc/routers/runs.ts (three close-out
 * sites), the merge path in ipc/git.ts, and recoverActiveStateOrphans itself
 * force-failing an orphan at boot. Every one of those bypasses the executor
 * hook, so the run keeps its raw_events but never gets the durable row. Adding
 * the call to each writer is how the gap opened in the first place — a sweep
 * over the invariant ("terminal + has usage events => has a row") cannot drift
 * as new terminal writers appear.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-21: 330 of 468 runs carrying usage data had no materialized
 * row (216 canceled, 103 failed, 6 completed, 5 stranded 'running'). Insights
 * still SHOWED their cost because selectRunUsageRollups falls back to a full
 * raw_events scan — which is why this was invisible, and why it is load-bearing
 * before any raw_events retention: pruning would delete the only copy.
 *
 * TERMINAL ONLY, DELIBERATELY. A run still running/awaiting has an incomplete
 * raw_events log; materializing mid-flight would freeze a partial rollup that
 * the read path then prefers over the truth. Those are left to the executor's
 * seam. This runs AFTER recoverActiveStateOrphans + the outcome backfills at
 * boot, so a run stranded by a crash has already been force-failed and is
 * eligible here on the same boot.
 *
 * Uses the FORCE-SCAN rollup helper for the same reason rollupRunUsage does its
 * DELETE first: the materialized-first reader would happily return the row we
 * are trying to create. Batched — one scan for every candidate, one
 * transaction — rather than N per-run round trips.
 *
 * `INSERT OR IGNORE` (not REPLACE): if a row appeared between the SELECT and the
 * write, the existing one wins. This can only ever ADD a missing row, never
 * overwrite a real rollup. Idempotent: a second run finds no candidates.
 *
 * Fail-soft: any error is logged and swallowed — a rollup backfill must never
