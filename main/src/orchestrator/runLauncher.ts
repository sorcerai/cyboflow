   *      degrade to null, never abort the launch).
   *   2. UPDATE workflow_runs with task_id + the triage columns. This is a
   *      `workflow_runs` write (NOT a `tasks` write) so it is done inline — the
   *      no-direct-`tasks`-write invariant only governs the `tasks` table.
   *   3. If the task currently sits in an ASSERTED, non-terminal planning stage
   *      and has no entry_stage_id yet, capture it via applyChange (chokepoint),
   *      so a later revert (dismiss / all-runs-terminal) restores it.
   *   4. recomputeTaskExecutionStage — the derived-stage write, also via the
   *      chokepoint. At launch the run is `starting`; the executor's pre_spawn
   *      transition advances it to `running`, at which point the executor calls
   *      recompute again to land the task on `In development`.
