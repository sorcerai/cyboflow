/**
 * Async-iterator throttle utility for tRPC v11 subscriptions.
 *
 * Standalone-typecheck invariant: no imports from 'electron',
 * 'better-sqlite3', or main/src/services/*.
 *
 * ## Coalescing semantics
 *
 * When the source produces multiple events within a single tick window
 * (1000/hz milliseconds), only the **latest** event is emitted — earlier
 * events in the same window are silently discarded. This is intentional:
 * the renderer cares about "current state of this run", not a replay of
 * every intermediate state. The raw EventEmitter source (consumed by the
 * raw_events DB writer) remains unthrottled and retains full fidelity.
 *
 * ## Memory-leak mitigation
 *
 * tRPC v11 subscriptions backed by high-frequency sources (e.g., long Bash
 * output) can saturate the IPC queue if every source event crosses the
 * boundary. This throttle caps the per-subscription emission rate at `hz`
 * events per second regardless of source throughput.
 *
 * ## Algorithm
 *
 * 1. A background consumer loop reads from `source`, always overwriting
 *    `latest`, setting `dirty = true`, and arming the cooldown.
 * 2. `armCooldown` runs a SINGLE `setTimeout(intervalMs)`. When it fires it
 *    moves `latest` into the queue, clears `dirty`, and re-arms; an expiry
 *    with nothing pending stops the chain instead.
 * 3. The outer generator dequeues and yields, blocking between dequeues
 *    until the next flush signal or source completion.
 *
 * ## Why on-demand timers, not a steady interval
 *
 * This used to arm `setInterval(1000/hz)` for the whole life of the
 * subscription, which ticked whether or not the source had produced anything.
 * In the Electron MAIN process that is expensive in a way it is not in plain
 * Node: libuv is driven by Chromium's CFRunLoop, so each fire costs a
 * `__CFRunLoopDoSources0 → uv_run → uv__run_timers` round trip plus a
 * `uv__loop_interrupt`/`kevent` to re-arm. Measured on an IDLE app, two live
 * subscriptions at `hz=60` fired ~98 times/second between them and did 0.8ms of
 * real work per 5000ms — ~2% of a core spent almost entirely on wakeup
 * overhead. Arming the timer only while a value is actually pending drops that
 * to ZERO timers when nothing is streaming, with identical emission semantics.
 *
 * ## Emission-timing equivalence
 *
 * The cadence is driven by a COOLDOWN chain, never by comparing wall-clock
 * timestamps. A value arriving while idle arms a timer for `intervalMs` and is
 * held until it fires — so, exactly as under the old fixed grid, the first
 * value of a burst is coalesced with everything else that lands in that window
 * rather than escaping on the leading edge. Each emission re-arms the cooldown;
 * when it expires with nothing pending, the chain stops and the subscription
 * goes back to holding no timer.
 *
 * Deliberately NO `Date.now()` arithmetic. Deriving the delay from a wall-clock
 * delta makes the throttle wrong across a system clock adjustment in both
 * directions: a backward jump would stall a pending final value for the size of
 * the jump, and a forward jump would compute a zero delay and let emissions
 * exceed `hz`. Relative timer delays are immune to both.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle / cleanup
 *
 * When the outer generator is returned or thrown (client disconnect, error),
 * the `finally` block sets `done = true`, clears any pending cooldown timer,
 * and cancels the source via `iterator.return()`.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT wait for the background consumer. Teardown here must
 * always complete promptly: a source parked in `next()` cannot see `done`, so
 * blocking on it would leave a client disconnect pending indefinitely. A source
 * is therefore expected to end on cancellation, but is not TRUSTED to — the
 * throttle stays correct either way.
 *
 * ## Why `signal` is needed for that to be true
 *
 * Cleanup code alone is not enough, because between emissions this generator is
 * suspended at an internal `await` (not at a `yield`). Calling `.return()` on an
 * async generator in that state does NOT run its `finally` — the request is
 * QUEUED until the generator next resumes. With an idle source there is nothing
 * to resume it, so a client disconnect would hang and the subscription would be
 * retained, with none of the teardown below ever executing.
 *
 * Passing the subscription's `AbortSignal` gives the generator an external wake:
 * on abort it resumes, breaks the loop, and runs teardown deterministically.
 * Callers that own a signal (every tRPC subscription does) SHOULD pass it.
 * Omitting it preserves the old behaviour exactly, including that hazard.
