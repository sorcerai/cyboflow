/**
 * cyboflow.verificationRequests sub-router (L6 / S7).
 *
 * Read-only typed tRPC contract backing the renderer's Verify-Queue panel — a
 * pure observability view over the `verification_requests` work queue (migration
 * 036 + `judge_calls_used` from 037). It MIRRORS the artifacts router's `list`
 * query exactly: a `protectedProcedure`, reaching the DB via `ctx.db`
 * (DatabaseLike), returning the shared `VerificationRequestRow[]` consumed on the
 * frontend by AppRouter inference ONLY (native tRPC serialization — NO IPCResponse
 * wrapper, no `{ success; data?; error? }` shape).
 *
 *   - list   : query -> VerificationRequestListRow[] (a project's verify requests,
 *              optionally narrowed by runId + status), newest-enqueued first, each
 *              enriched with its ORIGIN SESSION (run → session LEFT JOIN) for the
 *              panel's per-card session pill, and — additively, migration 095 —
 *              the classifier's `failureClass`/`modality`/`setupProof`/
 *              `failureEvidence` (docs/proposals/verification-setup-flow.md §3.1/
 *              §3.6). See {@link shapeRow}.
 *   - budget : query -> VerificationBudgetSummary (§3.6 "surface budget state in
 *              the Verify Queue") — a SIBLING query, not a field folded into
 *              `list`'s response, so `list` stays a flat array the renderer can
 *              index with `[number]` (`useVerificationRequests.ts`). Mirrors the
 *              exact `projects.visual_verify_budget_calls` /
 *              `SUM(judge_calls_used)` pair `VerificationScheduler
 *              .isProjectBudgetExhausted` already enforces at enqueue time
 *              (migration 056), so the number the panel shows can never
 *              silently diverge from the number the scheduler acts on.
 *
 *   - health : query -> VerificationHealthSummary (§6, the phase-3 health panel)
 *              — per-modality attempts / pass rate / failure-class histogram /
 *              median duration, the capability ledger (migration 095) with its
 *              re-probe TTLs resolved into a live `suppressionActive` bit, and
 *              setup-proof traffic counted APART from lane traffic (§8's
 *              "separate counter"). A third sibling query for the same reason
 *              `budget` is one: each has its own shape and its own refresh
 *              cadence in the panel.
 *
 *   - setupByProject : query -> VerifyProjectSetupRow[] (§6's project list) —
 *              whether EACH project has a proven runbook, in one pass over
 *              `verify_runbook_local`. Verification is configured per project,
 *              so a single global setup button can only ever speak for the
 *              selected one. `'proven'` is confirmed against the LIVE
 *              conjunction (`ctx.verifyRunbookStatus`), not the stored column —
 *              see {@link effectiveRunbookStatus}; the same applies to
 *              `health`'s per-modality `runbook.status`.
 *
 *   - hostProbes / provisionChromium : the §6 live host-capability probes and
 *              the chromium fix-it action. `provisionChromium` is the only
 *              mutation here and is NOT an entity write — it touches the host's
 *              browser cache, never the DB — so the read-only-over-the-schema
 *              property below is unaffected.
 *
 * The panel performs NO entity mutations (Accept-as-baseline lives on the
 * artifact verdict banner, S6) — this router stays read-only over the existing
 * schema, so there is no new migration and no chokepoint write path here.
 *
 * Standalone-typecheck invariant: no imports from 'electron', 'better-sqlite3',
 * or main/src/services/*.
