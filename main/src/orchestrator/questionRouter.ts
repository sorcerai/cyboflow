/**
 * QuestionRouter — singleton that owns the AskUserQuestion request/respond lifecycle.
 *
 * Design invariants (non-negotiable per ROADMAP-001 §5.7 and IDEA-025):
 *
 * 1. requestQuestion co-writes the questions INSERT and workflow_runs UPDATE
 *    inside a single db.transaction() guarded by `AND status='running'` on
 *    the UPDATE.  If the run is not in 'running' state, the transaction rolls
 *    back and requestQuestion throws RunNotRunningError. P4: that SAME
 *    transaction also co-writes a blocking decision review_items row (the
 *    AskUserQuestion gate is a decision the human must make), so the question
 *    row and the inbox row commit or roll back together; respond() resolves the
 *    folded item idempotently. No-op on a pre-migration-016 DB.
 *
 * 2. respond uses a guarded UPDATE `WHERE id=? AND status='awaiting_input'`
 *    and checks info.changes > 0 before writing the allow reply on the socket.
 *    If changes === 0, the run was concurrently canceled — no socket write,
 *    resolve the awaiting caller with a synthetic empty-answers payload.
 *
 * 3. Both requestQuestion and respond submit their mutations via a
 *    QuestionRouter-owned per-run p-queue (this.questionQueues), ensuring
 *    serialization of all question-mutations for the same run.  This queue
 *    is intentionally separate from RunQueueRegistry's per-run queue: that
 *    queue hosts the long-running runExecutor.execute() task, and re-entering
 *    it from inside a PreToolUse hook would self-deadlock (see
 *    runQueueRegistry.ts §no-recursive-enqueue rule).
 *
 * 4. Questions do NOT auto-expire. A pending question remains in the queue
 *    until the user answers (or the run is canceled). This matches the product
 *    invariant "workflow pauses until the human responds."
 *
 * 5. The user's answer flows back to the SDK through the PreToolUse hook's
 *    `updatedInput: { questions, answers }` payload (NOT through an injected
 *    tool_result). The SDK synthesizes the tool_result from updatedInput.answers;
 *    injecting our own tool_result would either duplicate or conflict with the
 *    SDK's own emission.
 *
 * Standalone-typecheck invariant: this file must NOT import from 'electron',
 * 'better-sqlite3', or any concrete service in main/src/services/*.
 * All collaborators are injected via the constructor.

  /**
   * Boot-time recovery for workflow_runs left in 'awaiting_input' by a previous
   * session (the in-process agent turn is gone after a restart).
   *
   * The agent *process* being gone does NOT mean the *conversation* is gone: a run
   * with a captured provider session/thread can be reopened by resuming that
   * conversation (runs.nudge re-drives it). So we split the stale runs:
   *   - RESUMABLE (provider resume target present AND last touched within
   *     STALE_RESUMABLE_RECOVERY_DAYS) → 'awaiting_review'. The run lands in the
   *     review queue and is nudge-resumable — NOT a dead end. (This is the
   *     "reopen after timeout" fix; mirrors the in-session teardown settle in
   *     clearPendingForRun.)
   *   - SESSIONLESS or STALE (no captured session, or older than the cap) →
   *     'failed' (error_message='app_restart') — genuinely unresumable, the
   *     original conservative behavior. The age cap keeps the review queue from
   *     accumulating ancient reopen candidates across many restarts.
   *
   * For BOTH buckets the orphaned in-flight gate is dead, so pending questions are
   * flipped to 'timed_out' and folded decision review_items resolved (audit
   * consistency + no lingering blocking items). A resumable run re-opens via a
   * fresh nudge turn, not by answering the stale gate.
   *
   * Returns the split counts: `resumable` runs rested in awaiting_review (NOT a
   * force-fail — nudge-resumable) and `failed` runs force-failed with
   * error_message='app_restart'. The boot-recovery telemetry aggregate counts
   * ONLY `failed` (see index.ts), so the two must stay separate.
