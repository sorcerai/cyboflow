/**
 * approvalCreatedBridge — resolves workflowName for SSE approval events.
 *
 * Extracts the JOIN logic that maps a workflow_run row to its human-readable
 * workflow name so the SSE-pushed ApprovalCreatedEvent carries the same
 * workflowName field that listPending returns for the same approval.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *  - JOIN at bridge (not inside ApprovalRouter.requestApproval) so the
 *    in-memory ApprovalRequest shape stays lean for the SDK PreToolUse hook,
 *    which never reads workflowName.
 *  - `awaited` is read from the approvals row rather than passed in, because
 *    this bridge serves two emitters: the original create, where it is always
 *    true, and ApprovalRouter.setAwaited's re-emit, whose whole purpose is to
 *    push the FLIPPED value to the renderer. Reading the row keeps one source of
 *    truth and means neither emitter has to remember to pass it.
 *  - Missing-row fallback: emit with workflowName='' and log a console.warn
 *    rather than throwing, because silent-drop creates an invisible discard
 *    mode that is harder to debug than a warn.
 *  - Uses truncatePayloadPreview from shared/utils/approvals.ts so the 512-char
 *    cap stays in one place alongside the listPending path.
 *
 * Standalone-typecheck invariant: this file must NOT import from 'electron',
 * 'better-sqlite3', or any concrete service in main/src/services/*.
