/**
 * workflowBundle — resolves a workflow's co-located `.claude/` command + agent
 * bundle from app-bundled assets (IDEA-013 rung-(ii): structure-as-invokable-units).
 *
 * A built-in flow's prose `.md` (e.g. `planner.md`) is paired with a sibling
 * directory of the SAME basename holding its invokable phase units:
 *
 *   workflows/planner.md                 ← the orchestrator prose (delegates phases)
 *   workflows/planner/agents/*.md        ← one subagent per heavy phase (own context)
 *   workflows/planner/commands/*.md      ← optional slash-commands (built-ins ship none)
 *
 * Resolving the bundle from the run's `workflow_path` (the SAME `.md` the prompt
 * body is read from) — rather than keying it by workflow NAME — means any flow
 * that reuses a built-in's prose automatically gets that built-in's bundle, and a
 * custom flow with its own self-contained `.md` (no sibling bundle dir) simply
 * resolves to an EMPTY bundle (fail-soft) and is unaffected.
 *
 * Each returned file carries a LOGICAL `name` (the asset filename minus `.md`);
 * the cyboflow `cyboflow-` namespace prefix and the `.claude/commands|agents`
 * target paths are owned by `WorkflowBundleWriter`, not here. This module is a
 * pure fs reader — no DB, IPC, or Electron imports — mirroring
 * `workflowPromptReader.ts` so it stays testable in plain Node/vitest.
 *
 * Path resolution mirrors `builtInWorkflows.ts` / `database.ts`: assets are
 * resolved relative to the resolved `workflow_path`, which `copy:assets` places
 * under `dist/main/src/orchestrator/workflows/` at build time.
