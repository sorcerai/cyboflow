/**
 * fan-out-instructions.ts
 *
 * Pure, side-effect-free generator for the per-run system-prompt APPEND that
 * tells the MAIN orchestrating session HOW to fan a step out over its runtime
 * item set — the per-item chain, the concurrency cap, and the dispatch / loopback
 * rules — derived entirely from the resolved `WorkflowDefinition`'s `fanOut`
 * specs.
 *
 * ── Why this is derived, not prose ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Until now the sprint's / ship's parallelism (DAG waves, the 5-cap, the per-task
 * implement→…→visual-verify chain) lived HARDCODED in `sprint.md` / `ship.md`.
 * That meant the workflow editor's fan-out toggle / inner-chain / maxConcurrency
 * edits could not actually drive orchestrated runs. This generator moves that
 * instruction block to runtime, keyed off `step.fanOut`, so an edited chain
 * (steps removed / added / renamed, a different cap, serial vs parallel) renders
 * the matching instructions. It is the exact sibling of
 * `buildStepReportingAppend` (step-reporting-instructions.ts): a pure function of
 * the resolved definition, spliced onto `systemPromptAppend` right after the
 * step-reporting block (see `workflowPromptReaderAdapter.ts`).
 *
 * ── Loopback default ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Each inner step's failure **loopback target** is `step.loopback` when set, else
 * THE FIRST inner step id (for the canonical sprint chain that is `implement`).
 * A step whose loopback target IS itself (the re-entry point — e.g. `implement`)
 * emits no "loop back" clause: it is the target, not a looper.
 *
 * Fail-soft: a `null` definition, or a definition with NO fanOut-bearing step,
 * yields the empty string — never a throw — so the wiring injects nothing rather
 * than garbage. Mirrors `buildStepReportingAppend`.
 *
 * No DB, IPC, or Electron imports — intentional; keep this module testable in
 * plain Node/vitest without bootstrapping the full app.
