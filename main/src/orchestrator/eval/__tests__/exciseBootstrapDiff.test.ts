/**
 * Unit tests for excising the runbook bootstrap's files from an eval diff
 * (docs/proposals/lane-runbook-bootstrap.md §11).
 *
 * `snapshotRunForEval` already exempts the verify-setup flow from auto-eval, and
 * its stated reason is exact: that flow's diff is "a verification runbook plus
 * isolation levers whose real acceptance test is its own proof run". The
 * bootstrap moves that same diff class into sprint/ship runs, which ARE graded
 * and A/B-compared — so a project that happens to need a bootstrap would start
 * scoring differently for reasons unrelated to the work.
 *
 * The tests that matter most are the ones about NOT breaking a diff: this is a
 * section splitter, not a diff parser, and every case it cannot understand must
 * return the input untouched. Grading an un-excised diff is a small unfairness;
 * corrupting one would put a mangled diff in front of a judge and score the
 * result.
