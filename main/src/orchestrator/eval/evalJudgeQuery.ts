/**
 * evalJudgeQuery — the SDK boundary for the code-review eval jury. This is the
 * ONLY `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` caller in the eval/ tree (value-loaded
 * lazily via utils/lazyAgentSdk so app boot never parses the SDK), exactly
 * mirroring monitorQuery.ts in the programmatic/ tree: keeping the jury, worker,
 * scoring, and snapshot SDK-free means they stay standalone-typecheckable and the
 * jury is fully fakeable in tests (inject a `EvalStructuredQueryFn` that returns a
 * canned object — no claude subprocess).
 *
 * A single call is a one-shot STRUCTURED query: send the judge prompt, enforce the
 * per-sub-check verdict schema via the SDK's native `outputFormat: json_schema`,
 * drain the stream, and return the `structured_output` from the success result.
 * Read-only tools (Read/Grep/Glob) + the frozen worktree as cwd let the judge grep
 * the snapshot before marking UNKNOWN (the rubric's evidence rule) — but the
 * worktree may be torn down mid-eval by a fast human merge, so the worker passes
 * cwd only when it still exists and the prompt is diff-self-contained regardless.
 *
 * v1 limitation (documented): the Agent SDK query() options expose NO temperature,
 * so the design's "temp 0" is unsettable; K-sample variance is whatever the model
 * produces. packaged builds MUST pass pathToClaudeCodeExecutable (asar ENOTDIR
 * spawn class) — resolveClaudeExecutablePath() handles it.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT live-verifiable headlessly (it makes a real Claude call).
 *
 * Standalone-typecheck note: nothing here imports electron / better-sqlite3 / a
 * concrete service beyond the claude-exe resolver and the pure model-alias helper.

/**

 * 10 min (was 5): a judge sample can hit the wall under HOST CONTENTION — the eval
 * runs its jurors while the user may have many other live Claude sessions spawned
 * — even on a small diff, and a whole-eval failure needs EVERY juror to miss the
 * deadline. Live ad-hoc runs showed a juror slot reproducibly missing the 5-min
 * wall while its siblings landed, silently shrinking the jury to 2/3 samples;
 * the extra headroom (plus the trimmed JUDGE_MAX_TURNS below) keeps the common
 * case landing the FULL sample count, not just one.
 *
 * This is the BASE, applied verbatim to a small diff. A caller that reports
 * `diffChars` gets it stretched by the shared judgeDeadline curve — a large diff
 * is more reading, and a flat wall made exactly those evals time out.

 * deadline is the real bound.
 *
 * History: 32 -> 20 because a generous exploration budget let the judge loop through
 * read-only round-trips long enough to blow a FIXED deadline even on a small diff.
 * Now 40, because both halves of that trade-off changed: the deadline scales with
 * diff size (judgeDeadline) instead of being flat, and evalJury.MAX_DIFF_CHARS
 * doubled, so far less is elided and the grep loop has less to chase. The trim
 * treated the symptom — jurors were looping because they had been handed 9% of a
 * large diff and told to go find the rest. Measured on the recorded eval history,
 * 20 turns was itself a top failure mode (7 lost slots to max-turns vs 17 to the
 * wall), so bounding exploration harder would have cost more samples, not fewer.
