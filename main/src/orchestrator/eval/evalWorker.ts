/**
 * EvalWorker — the async brain of the code-review eval. A process-wide singleton
 * with its OWN serial PQueue (concurrency 1, the canonical cyboflow task-queue
 * pattern — see reviewItemRouter / TaskChangeRouter). It owns the whole
 * post-trigger lifecycle:
 *
 *   snapshot(runId)  → snapshotRunForEval (frozen diff + provenance → pending row)
 *   enqueue(runId)   → queue.add(process)
 *   process(runId)   → pending→running, K jury samples, score, complete/failed,
 *                       write net-new findings through ReviewItemRouter.
 *
 * Crash-safe resume: `recoverInterrupted()` (called once at boot) re-enqueues any
 * row an app quit left in 'pending'/'running' — the frozen diff is captured in the
 * row, so a re-grade is self-contained and never leaves the panel polling a
 * perpetual 'running'. before-quit pauses the queue; in-flight samples abort via
 * the SDK deadline.
 *
 * Impurity lives HERE (SDK via the injected judge, DB writes, findings chokepoint);
 * scoring.ts stays pure. All electron-touching collaborators are injected as
 * closures at initialize() so the worker itself imports no concrete service —
 * mirroring ArtifactRouter's boot wiring.
