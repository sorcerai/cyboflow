/**
 * Removing the runbook bootstrap's own commits from a run's EVAL DIFF
 * (docs/proposals/lane-runbook-bootstrap.md §11).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. `snapshotRunForEval` already exempts the verify-setup
 * flow from auto-eval, and its stated reason is precise: that flow's diff is "a
 * verification runbook plus isolation levers whose real acceptance test is its
 * own proof run". The bootstrap moves exactly that diff class into SPRINT and
 * SHIP runs — which are auto-eval'd, rubric-graded, and A/B-compared. Without
 * this, a run gets scored on machine-written JSON none of its agents authored,
 * and a project that happens to need a bootstrap starts scoring differently from
 * one that does not, for reasons that have nothing to do with the work.
 *
 * EXCISED BY PATH, and only the paths the bootstrap actually wrote: the runbook
 * (a constant) plus the one rung-1 file recorded on the stamp. Two properties
 * follow, and both are deliberate:
 *
 *   - The runbook path is exclusively bootstrap-owned by construction, so
 *     dropping it can never remove a lane's work. Nothing else writes it, and
 *     address-review is told not to touch it.
 *   - The rung-1 path is NOT exclusively owned — a lane may legitimately have
 *     edited `package.json` too. Dropping the whole section slightly OVER-
 *     excises there. That is the right direction to be wrong: the alternative is
 *     grading a run on a config line a machine wrote, and the excess is one file
 *     in a diff that otherwise spans the run's real work.
 *
 * NOT A DIFF PARSER. It splits on `diff --git` section headers, which is the one
 * structural fact about unified diff output that is stable across git versions
 * and options. It never rewrites hunks, never renumbers, and returns the input
 * unchanged whenever it cannot find what it was asked to remove — an eval diff
 * this cannot understand is graded as it always was, which is worse than
 * excising but far better than corrupting.
