/**
 * WorkflowController — the host-side, deterministic DAG walker for the
 * `programmatic` execution model (Stage 1; see
 * docs/proposals/sdk-program-driven-workflows.md).
 *
 * This is the "code walks the DAG" engine. Given a `WorkflowDefinition` (the SAME
 * shared DAG the orchestrated model feeds to an agent), it sequences phases and
 * steps IN ORDER and owns every control-flow decision the orchestrated prose
 * otherwise asks the model to make:
 *
 *   - report each step boundary (running → done) to the live timeline,
 *   - run each non-human step's agent via the injected `StepRunner`,
 *   - honor the per-step `retries` budget (in-place re-attempts),
 *   - honor intra-phase `loopback` on exhaustion (bounded by MAX_STEP_LOOPBACKS),
 *   - skip `optional` steps that fail, escalate required steps that fail,
 *   - resolve human gates via the injected `ControllerHost.requestHumanGate`
 *     (approve advances, reject ends the run, revise loops back / re-presents).
 *
 * The controller is PURE with respect to its injected collaborators (StepRunner +
 * ControllerHost) — it performs no DB / IPC / SDK work itself — so it is
 * exhaustively unit-testable with fakes. The unverifiable live-SDK work lives
 * entirely behind `StepRunner`.
 *
 * Standalone-typecheck invariant: shared types + sibling protocol types only.

   * Walk a `fanOut` outer step: drive ONE lane per resolved item through the

   * step → `integrated` (all inner steps succeeded) or `failed` (a required inner
   * step failed). Items run in WAVES of at most `effectiveMaxConcurrency(fanOut)`
   * (the step's declared `maxConcurrency`, else SPRINT_BATCH_CAP — see
   * shared/types/workflows.ts) via `Promise.all`; a cap of 1 naturally serializes,
   * since the wave loop re-evaluates readiness after each wave settles. The abort
   * signal is checked between waves AND per inner step,
   * so a canceled run returns a terminal 'canceled' promptly. Lane writes go
   * through the injected fail-soft `host.fanOut.driveLane` (never throws); the
   * controller itself performs NO DB/IPC.
   *
   * Returns `{ terminal: false }` when the whole item set settled (the caller
   * then marks the outer step done), or `{ terminal: true }` ONLY on cancellation
   * (the caller ends the run 'canceled'). A required inner-step failure on ONE
   * item marks THAT lane 'failed' and stops that item, but does NOT terminate the
   * fan-out — sibling items continue and the outer step still settles 'done'
   * (the holistic verify/review OUTER steps after the fanOut catch real defects).
   *
   * Scheduling is DAG-aware (2026-06-22): a task is dispatched only once all of its
   * in-scope blocking prerequisites have integrated (via `host.fanOut.dependencies`);
   * a task whose prerequisite failed is marked failed (blocked). When the driver
   * exposes no dependencies this degrades to flat cap-sized waves. Expected task
   * files (when the driver exposes them) additionally serialize overlapping ready
   * items into later waves without reducing concurrency for disjoint items.
   * Required inner-step failures honor a declared inner `loopback`, re-driving the
   * lane through Ship's bounded three-attempt contract.
   *
   * Systemic failures: an inner step failing with `systemic === true` (env-level:
   * usage/rate limit, overload, auth) is NOT that lane's defect — it does NOT fail
   * the lane (nor skip an optional inner step). Instead driveItem bubbles it up as
   * 'systemic'; the wave loop keeps the paused item in `remaining` and parks the
   * WHOLE fan-out via `host.awaitSystemicPause` (bounded per outer step id by
   * `systemicPauses`/MAX_SYSTEMIC_PAUSES). On 'retry' the paused items re-dispatch;
   * on 'giveup' / seam-absent / budget-exhausted they are failed like a blocked
   * lane. `systemicPauses` is the SAME run-level map the single-step path uses,
   * keyed here on the outer step id.
   *
   * Operator LANE REWIND: `RunDirectives.laneRewinds` lets the monitor pull ONE
   * lane back to an earlier inner step while the fan-out stays live — sibling
   * lanes, the outer walk, and the run's step_results are untouched (that is the
   * whole-run `rewindRunHandler`'s job). The request is consulted at THREE points
   * in `driveItem` so it lands wherever the lane happens to be: idle between inner
   * steps, mid-agent-turn (the handler kills the lane's spawn to force the step to
   * return, and the pending request is what keeps the resulting failure from
   * failing the lane), and parked at the visual merge gate (woken via the
   * `laneInterrupts` unpark hook this method registers around the park). A rewind
   * restores the lane's automatic loopback budgets but never bumps its attempt
   * counter — see `clearStateForRewind`.
