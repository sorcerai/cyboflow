/**
 * monitor — the ON-DEMAND monitor brain for the programmatic execution plane (the
 * unify-monitor refactor; supersedes the Stage 3 supervisor + supervisor-chat
 * planes). The monitor renders into the run's EXISTING unified Chat pane (no
 * separate transcript store) and is TOKEN-FRUGAL: it consumes zero tokens during
 * routine step progress and reads the WHOLE run history ONLY when it must act —
 *
 *   - TRIAGE: a required step exhausts its retry/loopback budget. The monitor reads
 *     the full history, may inspect the worktree (read-only tools), and decides
 *     retry / escalate / fail WITH full context.
 *   - ANSWER: a human types in the run's chat. The monitor reads the full history
 *     and replies with a grounded, concise answer.
 *
 * Each call reads the whole history FRESH (`HistoryReader.read(runId)`) — there is
 * no accumulated in-memory feed (the canonical transcript is `raw_events`). The SDK
 * call is isolated behind two fakeable fns (`StructuredQueryFn` / `TextQueryFn` in
 * monitorQuery.ts, the SOLE SDK importer), so this brain is pure / fully
 * unit-testable without the SDK. Fail-soft on every path: triage → 'escalate',
 * answer → a short apology.
 *
 * Standalone-typecheck invariant: shared types + sibling protocol/store types only —

Recent conversation:
${digestConversation(history.conversation)}

The user asks:
${question}

Capabilities:
- You may attach AT MOST ONE action per reply, and ONLY when the user EXPLICITLY asks for it.
- Retrying / handover:
  - Action "retry_step": a retry, a resume, or a re-run of a failed or skipped step. Set \`stepId\` to the exact step id from the timeline above when the user names a step or the timeline makes clear which step failed/skipped; omit \`stepId\` to default to the run's failed step. This covers two cases: a FAILED or RESTING run, where it revives the run at the failed/skipped step; and a run currently PAUSED on a usage-limit item, where the host resolves that pause instead. Either way the host picks the right mechanism for the run's actual state and reports back which one happened. The HOST validates the run's state and reports the outcome back to the user — you never claim the retry succeeded yourself.
  - Action "switch_to_orchestrated": hand the ENTIRE run over to a full interactive agent that continues the remaining workflow conversationally. Offer this ONLY when the user's request cannot be served by "retry_step" or by simply answering — a freeform intervention such as "fix the conflict by hand then continue" or "change the approach for the remaining steps". NEVER attach it merely because a retry failed. Because it is ONE-WAY — the run does NOT return to step-by-step execution afterward — SUGGEST it in your reply first and WAIT for the user's EXPLICIT confirmation on a later turn before attaching it. In that suggestion, also warn the user that steps configured to run in a separate runtime (e.g. a Codex-pinned step) will be switched to this one — the single handover agent runs the entire remaining workflow itself. When you do attach it, set \`reason\` to a faithful 1-3 sentence summary of the user's outstanding request (what they want done after the handover). The HOST validates the run's state and executes the handover — you never claim it succeeded yourself.
- Task edits (the run's sprint/ship task fan-out): these apply to a NOT-YET-STARTED task and take effect starting from the run's NEXT wave — they cannot change a task whose work already began.
  - Action "add_task": add a new task. Set \`title\` (required), and optionally \`body\` and \`priority\`.
  - Action "remove_task": remove a not-yet-started task. Set \`taskRef\` (required) to its ref or id.
  - Action "edit_task": edit a not-yet-started task. Set \`taskRef\` (required) plus at least one of \`title\`, \`body\`, or \`priority\` to change.
- Step control:
  - Action "skip_step": skip an upcoming step the run HASN'T reached yet. Set \`stepId\` (required). Cannot change a step already running or finished.
  - Action "unskip_step": reverse a previously requested skip on an upcoming step. Set \`stepId\` (required). Same restriction as "skip_step" — cannot change a step already running or finished.
  - Action "steer_step": inject freeform operator guidance for a step. Set \`stepId\` and \`guidance\` (both required). If that step is CURRENTLY RUNNING the host also delivers the guidance live to its running agent(s) mid-flight; either way it is included in every future spawn of that step (including retries). Setting \`taskRef\` narrows to ONE sprint task's currently-running agent and is LIVE-ONLY: it is delivered to that agent mid-flight and NOT stored for future spawns (and fails if that task's agent isn't running the step right now) — omit \`taskRef\` to store the guidance for every future spawn. Steering a FAN-OUT phase step (one that fans out over sprint tasks) is likewise LIVE-ONLY: the guidance is broadcast to every currently-running sprint agent but nothing is stored (that step never spawns its own agent) — steer one of its INNER steps (e.g. 'implement') to store guidance durably.
  - Action "rewind_to_step": rewind the WHOLE run to an earlier step and re-run everything from that step onward. Set \`stepId\` (required) to a step at or before the run's current step (from the timeline above). Works even while the run is actively executing — the host safely stops current work first. Use when earlier output was wrong and later steps built on it; prefer "retry_step" for simply re-running a failed step.
  - Action "rewind_lane_to_step": rewind ONE sprint task's lane to an earlier step of ITS chain (e.g. back to 'implement'), leaving the run and every other lane running. Set \`taskRef\` (the task's ref or id) and \`stepId\` (an INNER lane step such as 'implement', 'code-review', 'task-verify' — NOT a phase step from the timeline), both required, with \`stepId\` at or before that lane's current step (see the sprint task lanes section above). The lane must be RUNNING right now; a queued lane hasn't started, and an integrated or failed lane has already settled — neither can be rewound this way. This is THE action for one stuck or misbehaving task: the host safely stops just that lane's agent and re-drives it from the step you name. Prefer it over "rewind_to_step" whenever the problem is confined to one task — the whole-run rewind throws away every other lane's work too.
- Review queue:
  - Action "resolve_review_item": resolve a pending gate, finding, or permission request by id. Set \`reviewItemId\` (required), and optionally \`outcome\` ("approve" or "reject") and \`resolution\` (a short note).
  - Action "file_note": file a non-blocking informational note into the run's review queue. Set \`title\` (required) and optionally \`body\`.
- For a pure question (no explicit action request), return no action.

CONFIRM BEFORE YOU ACT (host-enforced): when the user clearly wants a mutating action — any task edit, step-control, review-queue, or "file_note" action — ATTACH that action. The host will STAGE it (it does NOT execute yet) and show the user a pause marker asking them to confirm, so do NOT claim you already performed it. After the user EXPLICITLY confirms on the NEXT turn, attach an action of kind "confirm" to execute the staged action; if they decline or change their mind, attach kind "cancel" (or simply answer normally). A "confirm" with nothing staged does nothing, and a staged proposal EXPIRES if the very next turn is not a confirmation. "file_note" is low-risk but is still staged and confirmed the same way, for consistency. You may ask a clarifying question instead of attaching when the request is ambiguous (e.g. which task, which step, which review item). "retry_step" and "switch_to_orchestrated" are NOT staged this way — "retry_step" executes immediately, and "switch_to_orchestrated" keeps its own suggest-first-in-reply contract described above.

Answer concisely and concretely, grounding your reply in the run's history above. You have read-only tools (Read/Grep/Glob) for inspecting the worktree — use them when needed to answer accurately.

Return your response as structured output: { reply: string, action?: { kind: "retry_step" | "switch_to_orchestrated" | "add_task" | "remove_task" | "edit_task" | "skip_step" | "unskip_step" | "steer_step" | "rewind_to_step" | "rewind_lane_to_step" | "resolve_review_item" | "file_note" | "confirm" | "cancel", ...fields } }, where only the fields relevant to the chosen \`kind\` (see Capabilities above) should be set ("confirm"/"cancel" carry no fields; "rewind_to_step" and "rewind_lane_to_step" follow the same staged-confirm contract as the other steering kinds above). \`reply\` is the message shown to the user.`;

 * keeps its own pre-existing suggest-first-in-reply prompt contract (the model offers

 *
 * `rewind_to_step` IS gated, even though it superficially resembles `retry_step`:
 * a retry re-runs ONE already-failed step in place — a bounded, non-destructive
 * recovery affordance — whereas a rewind can abort work that is CURRENTLY in
 * flight and re-runs EVERY step from the target onward, discarding their prior
 * results. That much larger, potentially-destructive blast radius is exactly what
 * this gate exists to guard, so — unlike `retry_step` — it must be staged and
 * explicitly confirmed like the other steering kinds.
 *
 * `rewind_lane_to_step` is gated for the same reason at a smaller scale: it kills
 * one lane's in-flight agent turn and discards that lane's progress back to the
 * target step. Much narrower than a run rewind — no sibling lane and no step
 * result is touched — but still destructive to work already done, so it stays
