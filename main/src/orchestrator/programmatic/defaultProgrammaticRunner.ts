/**
 * DefaultProgrammaticRunner — the production `ProgrammaticRunner` that RunExecutor
 * delegates a programmatic run to. It assembles the per-run engine: resolve the
 * run's DAG (the SAME `WorkflowDefinition` the orchestrated model uses), build a
 * SpawnStepRunner (scoped agent turns) + a ProgrammaticRunHost (timeline + human
 * gates + optional monitor triage), drive the WorkflowController, then map the
 * terminal outcome onto the spawn contract RunExecutor expects:
 *
 *   - 'completed' → resolve (the run rests in awaiting_review).
 *   - 'rejected'  → resolve (a human declined a gate — a terminal human decision,
 *                   NOT an execution failure; the run rests for the user).
 *   - 'failed'    → throw (RunExecutor marks the run failed, identical to a
 *                   thrown orchestrator turn).
 *
 * The monitor-unify refactor folds the old Stage 3 supervisor + supervisor-chat
 * planes into a single ON-DEMAND `MonitorSession`, ALWAYS ON for programmatic runs
 * since the supervisor-role redesign (2026-07-05). When a `monitorFactory` is
 * provided the runner builds the monitor for the run, registers it in
 * `MonitorRegistry` (so the tRPC layer / renderer can reach it for chat), and
 * passes both the monitor and the run context's `injectEvent` into the host so
 * triage rationale renders in the run's existing Chat pane. There is NO separate
 * transcript store and NO continuous feed.
 *
 * The stateless collaborators (spawner, reporter, gate) are injected once at the
 * composition root; per-run state is bound inside run().
