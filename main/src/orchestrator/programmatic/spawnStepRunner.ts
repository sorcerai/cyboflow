/**
 * SpawnStepRunner — the SDK-backed `StepRunner` (Stage 2). Runs one workflow
 * step as a scoped agent turn via the existing spawn surface
 * (`ClaudeSpawnerLike.spawnCliProcess`, in production the SubstrateDispatchFacade
 * → ClaudeCodeManager). `spawnCliProcess` resolves when the agent's turn drains
 * cleanly (⇒ step ok) and rejects when the turn errors (⇒ step failed), so the
 * run mapping is a thin try/catch. Reusing the existing spawn path means the
 * run's MCP servers, agent overlay, worktree, and permission mode are all set up
 * exactly as for an orchestrated turn — only the prompt is narrowed to one step
 * (see composeStepPrompt).
 *
 * CANCELLATION: the SDK substrate treats an aborted query() as a CLEAN exit, so a
 * canceled turn RESOLVES spawnCliProcess (it does NOT reject). Inferring success
 * purely from a resolved promise would therefore misread a cancel as 'ok' and let
 * the controller keep walking. So after the spawn settles we consult the injected
 * AbortSignal: if it fired, the result is 'aborted' (the controller ends the walk
 * with a 'canceled' outcome) — distinct from a genuine 'failed' turn that retries
 * / loops back. A signal already aborted BEFORE the spawn short-circuits to
 * 'aborted' without spawning. A genuine (non-canceled) failure is additionally
 * classified via isSystemicStepError: when the error text signals an
 * environment-level condition (usage/session/rate limit, provider overload,
 * auth) the result is stamped `systemic: true` so the controller parks-and-waits
 * on that condition instead of burning the step's retry/optional/loopback budget.
 *
 * Constructed per-run by DefaultProgrammaticRunner with the run's panel/session/
 * worktree bound, then invoked once per step by the WorkflowController.
