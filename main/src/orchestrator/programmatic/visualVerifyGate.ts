/**
 * SchedulerVisualVerifyGate — the production `VisualVerifyGate` for the
 * programmatic model. It closes the visual merge-gate's ACTUATION boundary: in
 * orchestrated mode the orchestrator agent reads the looped-back lane (prose) and
 * re-delegates implement; in programmatic mode there is no agent watching, so the
 * controller must PARK the lane and AWAIT the async verdict itself. This resolver
 * is what the controller awaits.
 *
 * Mechanism (mirrors ReviewQueueHumanGate.resolve — humanGate.ts):
 *   1. SYNC short-circuit when verification is not enabled for the run (isActive
 *      false) — the controller skips parking entirely (byte-identical to today).
 *   2. SUBSCRIBE to the scheduler's `verificationEvents` BEFORE checking current
 *      state, so a verdict that lands between check and await cannot slip through.
 *   3. RACE-CLOSER: the request is fire-and-continue and the scheduler drains
 *      async, so the verdict may have ALREADY landed. Read the lane's request
 *      state now — attributed STRICTLY (taskRef match, or the single-lane case):
 *        - no request ATTRIBUTABLE to the lane (subagent SKIPPED in-band, or a
 *          sibling lane's request in a multi-lane batch) → 'advance' (nothing to
 *          wait for — never park a lane with no request of its own; finding #3).
 *        - already terminal → resolve the outcome from the terminal STATUS.
 *        - non-terminal (queued/leased/running) → await the terminal event.
 *   4. On the matching terminal event, resolve the outcome from the terminal
 *      request STATUS (the verdict category the event carries), NOT from the
 *      lane's mutable step id — a concurrent controller park write can clobber
 *      `currentStepId` back to `awaiting-verify` after the merge-gate wrote
 *      `implement`, so keying the outcome on the step id silently turned a FAIL
 *      into an 'advance' (finding #1). The lane is read ONLY for the attempt count
 *      + the cap-fail signal (lane.status, lane.attempts — neither of which the
 *      park write touches).
 *   5. On the run's abort signal, resolve 'aborted' and remove listeners (a
 *      canceled run never hangs here; VerificationScheduler.cancelForRun also
 *      sweeps the request rows + emits, so the event path is belt-and-suspenders).
 *
 * Outcome mapping (from the terminal STATUS + the clobber-immune lane fields):
 *   passed / low_confidence / skipped / timeout → 'advance' (mirrors the merge-gate:
 *                                              PASS/advisory advance-integrated, or
 *                                              a skipped/timeout no-op that must
 *                                              never wedge the lane)
 *   failed + lane marked 'failed' (3× cap hit) → 'failed'
 *   failed + lane still running (looped back)  → 'loopback' (attempt = the
 *                                              lane.attempts the merge-gate wrote)
 *
 * Standalone-typecheck invariant: imports ONLY node:events, the electron-free
 * SprintLaneStore + the scheduler's event types + the narrow DatabaseLike /
 * LoggerLike + shared types — no 'electron' / 'better-sqlite3' / 'fs' / services.
