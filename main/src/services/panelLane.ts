/**
 * panelLane — the SINGLE answer to "which agent process owns THIS chat panel".
 *
 * A chat panel sits on two independent axes:
 *
 *   provider  — claude | codex | omp. Session-wide (`sessions.agent_runtime`); a
 *               panel cannot disagree with its session about which vendor runs it.
 *   substrate — sdk | interactive. PER-PANEL: the Add-chat picker and
 *               claude-panels:set-substrate stamp `panels.substrate`, which wins
 *               over the session's.
 *
 * The dispatch seams used to collapse both axes into one test against
 * `agent_runtime` — `=== 'codex-pty'` meant "Codex", `=== 'codex-sdk'` meant
 * "SDK". That reads the SESSION's substrate as if it were the PANEL's, so a
 * per-panel override could not be honored on the Codex side at all:
 *
 *   - in a codex-sdk session an interactive override fell to the CLAUDE PTY
 *     manager (the provider silently flipped mid-session), and
 *   - in a codex-pty session the `=== 'codex-pty'` test ran ahead of any
 *     substrate test, so an sdk override was ignored outright.
 *
 * Resolving the two axes separately and combining them at the END gives all four
 * lanes, so the picker means what it says in every session type. Callers switch
 * on the lane instead of re-deriving it — a new dispatch seam that forgets one
 * axis is the bug this module exists to prevent.

/**
 * The (provider × substrate) combinations, one manager each.

 * The two `omp-*` lanes are DECLARED ahead of their managers so every dispatch
 * seam is taught about them in one place rather than discovered one at a time
 * later. They are unreachable today — no session can be created on an OMP
 * runtime (the provider defaults to disabled and both runtimes are unselectable
 * in every picker) — and nothing registers a manager for them, so a lane lookup
 * would hit `resolveLaneManager`'s loud miss rather than silently fall to Claude.
 * `OmpSdkManager` / `OmpPtyManager` register in Phase 1 (§5.1, §5.2).
 *
 * Kept as a literal tuple with the union derived FROM it (the shape
 * `AGENT_PROVIDERS` uses) so a caller that has to enumerate every lane — the
 * boot wiring, a test registering one manager per lane — reads the list rather
 * than rebuilding it and quietly omitting one.
