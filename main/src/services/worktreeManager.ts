  /**
   * Whether this worktree's branch appears to have ALREADY LANDED in the main
   * branch — the "the agent merged it for me in chat" case, which our own merge
   * path never observed and therefore never stamped.
   *
   * Answering this from git is unavoidably heuristic, because a landing can
   * rewrite the commits: a squash produces one commit with different SHAs and a
   * different shape, a cherry-pick or rebase produces equivalent patches with
   * new SHAs. So we ask three questions and accept any yes:
   *
   *   1. `rev-list <main>..HEAD` is empty — every commit is literally in main
   *      (a fast-forward or rebase landing).
   *   2. `git cherry` reports no '+' commits — every commit has a patch
   *      equivalent in main (cherry-pick / rebase-with-new-SHAs).
   *   3. `git diff <main> HEAD` is empty — the two trees are identical, which is
   *      what a squash landing leaves behind when main has not moved on.
   *
   * `ownCommits` (measured from git's own `--fork-point`, falling back to a
   * plain merge-base) is what keeps an EMPTY session quiet: with no commits of
   * its own, questions 1 and 3 are vacuously true, and prompting the operator to
   * "mark complete" a session that did nothing would be pure noise. A session
   * that never committed reports landed=false.
   *
   * False negatives are the safe direction and are expected — a squash landing
   * followed by unrelated commits on main answers no to all three. The operator
   * still reaches the same decision through the merge dialog's
   * already-up-to-date path.
   *
   * Never throws: any git failure reports landed=false (fail-closed — a probe
   * that cannot see the repo must not claim work landed).

  /**
   * Merge a per-task run's worktree branch into an ARBITRARY target branch — the
   * parallel-sprint integration branch (`sprint/<id8>`) — instead of main. A
   * generalization of {@link mergeWorktreeToMain}: same rebase-then-fast-forward
   * semantics, parameterized on the target. Does NOT special-case main.
   *
   * Topology: the target (integration) branch is a BARE ref (no checkout); each
   * per-task run branch was cut off the integration tip via
   * `createDeterministicWorktree(..., baseBranch=integrationBranch)`. So:
   *   1. rebase the worktree branch onto the (possibly advanced) integration tip
   *      — resolves conflicts in the worktree, never touching the shared ref;
   *   2. fast-forward the integration ref to the rebased worktree HEAD via
   *      `git branch -f` (a strict ff by construction once the rebase succeeds,
   *      because the rebased branch is an ancestor-descendant of the integration
   *      tip). Because the integration branch is never checked out, `branch -f`
   *      cannot be refused for "checked out in a worktree".
   *
   * On a rebase conflict (or any non-ff) the rebase is aborted in the worktree and
   * a typed {@link MergeConflictError} is thrown — the scheduler marks the batch
   * task `failed` and continues draining other tasks (the batch does NOT crash).
   * On success the integration branch points at the run's content; the caller
   * (scheduler) then removes the worktree + deletes the run branch.
