 * Methods whose payload is a CUMULATIVE SNAPSHOT rather than an increment: each
 * notification restates the whole current value, so every row but the last is
 * dead weight the moment its successor arrives. Appending them was measured at
 * ~80 MB / 37k rows of the production raw_events table, ~98% of it superseded:
 *   - turn/diff/updated        68 MB over 3,739 rows for 138 turns — the FULL
 *                              working-tree diff re-sent per update (one turn
 *                              logged 113 snapshots growing 70 KB -> 95 KB).
 *   - thread/tokenUsage/updated 7 MB over 16,795 rows — a cumulative per-turn
 *                              counter sampled ~25x per turn.
 *   - account/rateLimits/updated 5 MB over 16,800 rows carrying just 276
 *                              distinct payloads — an account-wide gauge
 *                              re-persisted on every event tick.
 *
 * Each maps to a dedup_key slug. Keyed by run + turn (+ method), the INSERT
 * below becomes last-write-wins via the partial unique index on dedup_key
 * (migration 071), so the table keeps exactly one current row per turn instead
 * of the whole superseded history. Migration 112 collapses the rows already
 * written and stamps the same keys on the survivors, so a live run upserts onto
 * its historical row rather than starting a second one beside it.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT the delta-method treatment above: those are dropped
 * because a durable final lands elsewhere, whereas these have no other home —
 * the final snapshot IS the data, and it is preserved.
