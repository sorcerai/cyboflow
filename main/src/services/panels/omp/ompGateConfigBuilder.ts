/**
 * ompGateConfigBuilder — composes the `CYBOFLOW_OMP_GATE_CONFIG` payload the
 * spawned `omp` process's gating extension reads (proposal §5.3).
 *
 * The gate extension is the SOLE policy engine for an OMP session
 * (`gate/ompGateExtension.ts`); this module is the host half that tells it what
 * cyboflow's policy actually is for one spawn. Three translations happen here
 * and nowhere else:
 *
 *  1. TOOL NAMES. cyboflow's policy is written against Claude's names (`Bash`,
 *     `Edit`, `mcp__cyboflow__cyboflow_report_finding`); OMP's canonical names
 *     are lowercase (`tools/builtin-names.ts:1-31`) and its MCP names use a
 *     single underscore with the redundant server prefix stripped
 *     (`mcp/tool-bridge.ts:345-358`). {@link toOmpToolName} does the mapping.
 *  2. THE READ-SAFE SET. Mirrors the INTENT of cyboflow's
 *     `ACCEPT_EDITS_SAFE_READONLY_TOOLS` (`main/src/orchestrator/safeCommandClassifier.ts:47-54`)
 *     onto OMP's read-tier builtins — see {@link OMP_AUTO_ALLOW_TOOLS}.
 *  3. THE EDIT SET. Mirrors `ACCEPT_EDITS_AUTO_APPROVE_TOOLS`
 *     (`main/src/orchestrator/permissionModeMapper.ts:39`) onto OMP's
 *     write-tier file tools — see {@link OMP_EDIT_TOOLS}.
 *
 * Both sets are cyboflow's own, deliberately NOT OMP's tiering: OMP's `write`
 * approval tier includes every MCP tool, which is far wider than cyboflow's
 * acceptEdits allowance (proposal §5.3, "OMP's tool-tier classification is never
 * cyboflow's trust boundary").

/**
 * OMP built-ins cyboflow pre-clears as read-safe, auto-allowed in every gated
 * mode. Each is read-tier in OMP AND has a counterpart in cyboflow's own
 * read-safe set (`safeCommandClassifier.ts:47-54` — Read / Glob / Grep / LS /
 * NotebookRead / TodoWrite):
 *
 *   read      ↔ Read           (`tools/read.ts:401`)
 *   glob      ↔ Glob + LS      (`tools/glob.ts:107`)
 *   grep      ↔ Grep           (`tools/grep.ts:906`)
 *   ast_grep  ↔ Grep-class     (`tools/ast-grep.ts:151`)
 *   todo      ↔ TodoWrite      (`tools/todo.ts:797`)
 *
 * Plus two of OMP's HIDDEN tools (`HIDDEN_TOOL_NAMES = ['yield','goal','think']`,
 * `tools/builtin-names.ts`), which have no Claude counterpart because Claude has
 * no equivalent concept. Neither reaches outside the model's own turn:
 *
 *   yield     the agent's RETURN VALUE — "submit data or error", how a task
 *             reports success or failure (`tools/yield.ts`). Pure control flow.
 *   think     "private scratchpad; not shown to user" (`tools/think.ts`).
 *
 * `goal` is the third hidden tool and is deliberately NOT here: it sets a
 * persistent autonomous objective for the session, which is precisely the kind
 * of self-direction a human gate exists to show someone.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, AND WHY — these two were proposed for this list and both
 * would have been holes:
 *
 *   eval  executes Python/JavaScript/Ruby/Julia in a persistent backend
 *         (`tools/eval.ts`). Arbitrary code execution, not coordination. It is
 *         already named in the gate's own `AUTO_MODE_HAZARD_TOOLS`.
 *   hub   is coordination AND process control behind one name: `op:'start'`
 *         runs an arbitrary `application`, and `op:'send'` with `name` types
 *         into a live process's stdin. It is classified BY ARGUMENT in the
 *         gate (`isCoordinationHubCall`), which a name list cannot express.
 *
 * Everything else OMP happens to tier `read` is deliberately absent, because
 * cyboflow's set is about "touches nothing outside this repo", not about OMP's
 * tier: `web_search` reaches the network; `memory_edit`/`retain` mutate OMP's
 * memory store; `checkpoint`/`rewind` mutate git state; `inspect_image` hands
 * bytes to a vision provider. Each of those falls through to the human instead.
 *
 * THE REMOTE-TARGET NARROWING LIVES IN THE GATE, NOT HERE. OMP's `read`/`grep`
 * escalate themselves to `exec` tier when the path targets `ssh://`
 * (read.ts:401-402, grep.ts:906-909) — a remote operation over the user's own
 * SSH credentials. This list cannot express that, because it is a list of names.
 * The gate refuses every name-based shortcut whose ARGUMENTS carry a URI scheme
 * (`hasUriSchemeTarget` in `gate/ompGateExtension.ts`), so an `ssh://` read
 * reaches the human even though `read` is named here. Do not "fix" that by
 * splitting this list — the argument is what decides, and only the gate sees it.

 * whole reason this changed. The original comment read "OMP's docs say subagents
 * run forced-yolo". That sentence has no source, which stands out in a file
 * where every other external claim cites a line (`runner.ts:1235-1270`,
 * `wrapper.ts:201-235`, `read.ts:401`). The proposal it derives from says
 * something weaker and different: §2 fact 5 records that OMP's GLOBAL
 * `tools.approvalMode` defaults to `yolo` — a session-wide setting cyboflow
 * already overrides with `--approval-mode always-ask` — and the risk table
 * records hook scope inside subagents as "unknown", not as documented-yolo.
 * omp v17.3.5's own surfaces tie `yolo` only to that global setting, whose
 * description reads "'Yolo' auto-approves all tiers; user policy may still
 * prompt or block". Two true facts got welded into a third that nobody checked.
 *
 * Being empirical, it was testable. Probed live against omp v17.3.5 on
 * 2026-08-23, in an `auto` session, with `task` allowed:
 *
 *   23:00:48.748  allowed `task` (auto-tool)     <- parent dispatches
 *   23:00:54.039  allowed `bash` (allow-rule)    <- THE SUBAGENT's call, GATED
 *   23:00:59.922  parent's next tool call (`hub`)
 *
 * The parent's own transcript shows NO tool call between its `task` at
 * 23:00:48.752 and its `hub` at 23:00:59.922, so the gated `bash` at 23:00:54
 * was the subagent's; the file it wrote landed carrying the expected marker. The
 * handler fires inside a `task` subagent. The premise does not hold.
 *
 * TASK ISOLATION, decided in the same change as the old note required. §6 item 8
 * planned a `task.isolation.mode: none` overlay because OMP's subagent
 * overlay/rcopy isolation was untested inside a cyboflow git worktree. The same
 * probe answered it: a subagent told to write a RELATIVE path put the file in
 * the session's own worktree, visible to the parent — OMP's default already
 * behaves as `none` here. No overlay is configured, because configuring one
 * would pin a behaviour we are not otherwise exercising.
 *
 * THE RESIDUAL RISK, stated without the embellishment the old note carried: this
 * relies on gating and isolation behaviour of an external binary that nothing
 * here pins or asserts, and OMP ships fast. It is NOT "the docs say otherwise" —
 * no such doc has been found. A version tripwire is the obvious follow-up, and
 * pinning isolation explicitly needs OMP's real config key.
 *
 * THE FAIL-CLOSED DEFAULTS ARE UNCHANGED. `MOST_RESTRICTIVE_GATE_CONFIG` and
 * `parseGateConfig` both still default `denyTaskTool` to TRUE, so a missing or
 * malformed config still denies subagent dispatch. Only this builder — which
 * runs when the config IS well-formed — now allows it.
 *
 * The merged rules' DENY half is intentionally not forwarded: the gate has no
 * deny-rule grammar, and a denied call that is merely absent from `allowRules`
 * falls through to the human rather than being auto-allowed — the safe
 * degradation. Only `auto` mode consults `allowRules` at all.
