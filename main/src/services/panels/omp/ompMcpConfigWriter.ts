/**
 * Writer for `<worktree>/.omp/mcp.json` — how the `cyboflow` MCP server (the
 * `cyboflow_*` tool surface) reaches an OMP session (proposal §5.4).
 *
 * SCOPE: this is the config the future `OmpSdkManager` (`omp --mode rpc`,
 * Phase 1 §5.1) writes at spawn. **The `omp-pty` interactive terminal lane
 * gets NO MCP in v1** (proposal §5.2: "No MCP, no structured side-channel — T0
 * floor by design") — `OmpPtyManager` never calls this writer. It lives here
 * (not co-located with the SDK manager, which does not exist in this task's
 * file set) because the MCP config contract and the git-exclude seam it needs
 * are independent of which manager ends up calling it.
 *
 * ONE STATIC FILE serves every concurrent lane sharing a worktree, regardless
 * of run id: the `env` values below are OMP's documented "bare-name" form
 * (`docs/mcp-config.md` §"Secrets and variable resolution", pre-connect
 * resolution step 3–4) — a value that names a set environment variable is
 * copied from the **omp process's own env** at spawn time, not from this file.
 * Cyboflow injects the real `CYBOFLOW_RUN_ID`/`CYBOFLOW_ORCH_SOCKET` into each
 * spawn's process env (the same way `runConfig.ts`'s Codex app-server config
 * and `writeInteractiveMcpConfig`'s Claude interactive config do it, except
 * those bake the literal value into a config written PER SPAWN — OMP's file is
 * written once and read by whichever lane happens to load it next). A missing
 * env var resolves to the literal string per OMP's own semantics (loud, not
 * silent — `cyboflowMcpServer` exits 1 on a malformed run id).

 * `runConfig.ts`'s `buildMcpConfig` (the Codex app-server precedent) obtains
 * them from its caller's already-resolved `CodexAppServerMcpRuntimeConfig`.
 *
 * `timeout: 0` disables OMP's 30s per-server MCP timeout (`mcp-config.md`
 * §"Supported server fields") — mandatory, not a tuning choice: a blocking
 * human gate (`cyboflow_request_user_input`) would otherwise be killed
 * mid-wait, the same lesson that set Codex's `tool_timeout_sec` to a week
 * (`runConfig.ts`'s `buildMcpConfig` comment).
 *
 * `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` (when `nodeExecutablePath` resolves to the packaged
 * Electron binary rather than a standalone `node`) is baked in as a LITERAL
 * value here, unlike the bare-name run-id/socket entries: whether the host
 * has a real `node` on PATH is a machine-wide fact, invariant across every
 * concurrent lane, so there is no per-spawn indirection to preserve.
