/**
 * InteractiveClaudeManager — the interactive (subscription-billed) Claude
 * substrate (IDEA-013 S3 / TASK-808).
 *
 * A sibling of ClaudeCodeManager (the SDK substrate). It extends
 * AbstractCliManager and OVERRIDES ONLY the abstract hooks — the LIVE base PTY
 * machinery (`spawnPtyProcess`, `setupProcessHandlers`, `killProcessTree`) is
 * inherited VERBATIM and must NOT be redeclared here (grep-enforced).
 *
 * Unlike the SDK manager, this drives a REAL interactive `claude` REPL with no
 * headless print flag and no stream-json output flag (the interactive REPL is
 * the noise terminal stream). Structured panel fidelity is instead
 * recovered out of band by a `TranscriptTailSource` (TASK-807) that tails the
 * on-disk `~/.claude/projects/<key>/<uuid>.jsonl` transcript and surfaces
 * ALREADY-NORMALIZED, stream-json-shaped panel objects. Each such line flows:
 *   narrow -> router.emitForRun(runId) -> emit('output', { panelId, sessionId,
 *   type: 'json', data, timestamp })
 * FIELD-IDENTICAL to the SDK envelope (claudeCodeManager.ts:383-389) so
 * runEventBridge + the structured Claude panel need ZERO edits.
 *
 * COMPLETION is TURN-END-driven (Probe C). Interactive `claude` writes NO
 * terminal `{type:'result'}` line and the REPL does NOT self-exit. On the
 * TranscriptSource `onTurnEnd` signal we write EOF/`/exit` to PTY stdin to end
 * the REPL turn; the inherited `setupProcessHandlers.onExit` (after a short
 * transcript-drain settle window) is what RESOLVES the spawn promise — so a
 * hung PTY awaiting input (no turn-end) NEVER spuriously resolves. PTY
 * quiescence is explicitly REJECTED as the completion signal.
 */

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Per-option parity table (decision record — mirror of the SDK manager).
 * Each row is the EXPLICIT interactive decision vs the SDK branch it mirrors.
 *
 *   model            : pass `--model X` ONLY when (model && model !== 'auto');
 *                      the DB session_info row uses (model || 'default').
 *                      Mirrors claudeCodeManager.ts:463 / :295.
 *   permissionMode   : 'ignore' (dontAsk / auto-allow) SKIPS the gating shell
 *                      hook — matching the SDK's permissionMode==='ignore'
 *                      branch that omits the PreToolUse hook
 *                      (claudeCodeManager.ts:446). The opt-out branch is owned by
 *                      resolveInlineGatingHooks (interactiveSettingsWriter.ts) —
 *                      'ignore'/'dontAsk'/'auto' omit the PreToolUse key (no
 *                      gate) from the returned fragment. The manager adds NO
 *                      second gate (single source of truth). The Stop turn-end
 *                      hook (IDEA-030) has NO opt-out and is always present in
 *                      the same fragment — resolveInlineGatingHooks never
 *                      returns null.
 *   strictMcpConfig  : threads `--strict-mcp-config` iff strictMcpConfig===true,
 *                      so only the per-run `.mcp.json` servers load and user
 *                      globals cannot interfere with the permission bridge.
 *                      Mirrors claudeCodeManager.ts:188.
 *   settings/hooks   : the PreToolUse `'*'` shell-approval hook rides the single
 *                      inline `--settings '<json>'` flag buildCommandArgs already
 *                      emits (hooks key from resolveInlineGatingHooks). Probe-
 *                      verified on CLI 2.1.201 (2026-07-06): flag-tier hooks FIRE
 *                      and BLOCK (exit 2 stopped the tool call) and are ADDITIVE
 *                      to file-based hooks. This replaces the TASK-819 on-disk
 *                      write into `<worktree>/.claude/settings.json` — inline
 *                      delivery writes NOTHING into the working tree, which is
 *                      what allows in-place sessions (migration 047) on this
 *                      substrate. spawnCliProcess still calls
 *                      settingsWriter.remove() so a LEGACY on-disk entry from an
 *                      older build cannot double-fire alongside the inline one.
 *                      The SAME flag also always carries a Stop hook (IDEA-030):
 *                      newer CLIs stopped reliably emitting the transcript
 *                      turn-end markers, so a deterministic Stop-hook signal
 *                      (stopShellHook.js) notifies the orchestrator over the
 *                      socket, which routes it to notifyTurnEnd -> the SAME
 *                      handleTurnEnd path the transcript marker uses. No
 *                      permissionMode opt-out applies to it.
 *   resume/isResume  : the legacy boolean `isResume` is still ignored (no
 *                      `--resume` is emitted from it). RESUME of a lost quick
 *                      session is driven by the explicit `resumeSessionId` option
 *                      below: when set, buildCommandArgs emits a PLAIN
 *                      `--resume <uuid>` (NO `--fork-session`). claude reopens the
 *                      SAME session id and appends to the existing transcript, so
 *                      sessions.claude_session_id stays correct across restarts with
 *                      no rewind and no re-persist. (`--fork-session` was rejected:
 *                      it forks the transcript lazily on the first turn, so an eager
 *                      prompt-less resume would diverge from the stored id and
 *                      silently rewind on the next restart.) The snapshot-diff
 *                      TranscriptTailSource cannot DISCOVER the pre-existing file,
 *                      so the spawn path binds it directly from EOF
 *                      (bindKnownFileFromEnd) to keep the structured pipeline (token
 *                      meter) flowing; the live xterm rides the raw PTY byte path.
 *   systemPromptAppend: the `options.systemPromptAppend` field is intentionally
 *                      UNREAD on this substrate (the interactive REPL has no SDK
 *                      `systemPrompt.append` channel). The workflow prompt appends
 *                      — step-reporting (S6/TASK-811) AND the derived fan-out
 *                      execution instructions — are delivered instead via a
 *                      prompt-body PREPEND in `composePromptBody`, both resolved
 *                      from the run's frozen effective definition.
