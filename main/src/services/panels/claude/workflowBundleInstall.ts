/**
 * workflowBundleInstall — the substrate-shared seam that resolves a run's
 * co-located command/agent bundle and installs it into the run's worktree
 * (IDEA-013 rung-(ii)). Called from BOTH managers' spawn paths
 * (interactiveClaudeManager.spawnCliProcess and claudeCodeManager.spawnCliProcess)
 * so the `/cyboflow-<phase>` invokable units land for either substrate; removal is
 * each manager's own teardown (interactive: teardownRun; SDK: cleanupCliResources)
 * via `WorkflowBundleWriter.remove`.
 *
 * The bundle is keyed off the run's `workflows.workflow_path` — the SAME `.md`
 * the prompt body is read from — so any flow using a built-in's prose gets that
 * built-in's sibling bundle, and a quick session / custom flow with no sibling
 * bundle dir resolves to an empty bundle and writes nothing (fail-soft).
 *
 * Unlike the dumb `WorkflowBundleWriter` (fs-only, standalone-typecheck-safe),
 * this helper bridges DB + resolver + writer, so it MAY import better-sqlite3 and
 * the orchestrator resolver (same latitude as the managers that call it).
