/**
 * Streaming-input prompts for the Agent SDK `query()`.
 *
 * SDK 0.3.201 delivers interactive permission gates — AskUserQuestion and every
 * other `canUseTool` "ask" prompt — as `can_use_tool` control_requests whose
 * control_response must be written back over the query's INPUT stream. A bare
 * STRING prompt is single-shot: stdin closes after the first message, so those
 * control roundtrips fail with "Stream closed" and the gate seam
 * (`routeAskUserQuestion`) never runs. Driving `query()` with an
 * `AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage>` keeps stdin open, which restores the gate.
 *
 * TWO variants share the SAME drain-then-park engine (createPushablePromptInput)
 * but differ in how the DRIVER treats the input's lifetime:
 *
 *   - {@link createStreamingPromptInput} — SINGLE-SHOT. Yields the prompt once,
 *     then parks until {@link StreamingPromptInput.close}. Used for the lane-spawn
 *     path (programmatic fan-out), where every turn is a fresh single-item query()
 *     that tears the subprocess down at turn end. It is now ALSO pushable
 *     ({@link StreamingPromptInput.push}) so an operator can interject a MID-TURN
 *     steering message into a running step agent — a `priority: 'now'` user message
 *     the CLI's steering queue delivers at the agent's next loop boundary within
 *     the CURRENT turn. This does NOT make the single-shot input multi-turn: it
 *     still closes at the turn's result event (the driver's shouldClose branch).
 *   - {@link createPersistentPromptInput} — MULTI-TURN (warm sessions). Yields the
 *     initial prompt, then loops: each {@link PersistentPromptInput.push} feeds a
 *     new user message into the SAME live `query()` (a new cyboflow turn) without
 *     respawning the claude subprocess; {@link PersistentPromptInput.close} ends the
 *     generator so the CLI exits. This is what makes a warm SDK session skip the
 *     ~5s per-turn bootstrap: one `query()` spans many cyboflow turns.
 *
 * The former "one cyboflow turn is one query()" contract now holds only for the
 * single-shot/lane path; a persistent input's `query()` outlives its turns.

 * inverted that — an unstamped user message is now treated as UNATTRIBUTED and
 * fails closed at the CLI's strict `isHuman()` trust gates, which is how the
 * cross-session peer-messaging work distinguishes a real operator turn from a
 * machine-injected one. Everything this factory builds is first-party host
 * input carrying the operator's authority (a composer message, or an
 * orchestrator prompt for a run the operator launched), so stamping `human`
 * PRESERVES the pre-bump semantics rather than granting new authority. Peer
 * traffic never reaches this path — the harness stamps `{ kind: 'peer' }` on
 * that itself, from kernel-verified credentials we cannot forge from here.
 *
 * `opts.steering` stamps `priority: 'now'` — the CLI's steering-queue priority
 * that interjects the message into the CURRENT in-flight turn at the agent's next
 * loop boundary (the same engine as typing while Claude works in the interactive
 * REPL). A normal turn omits `priority`, so its serialized bytes are unchanged.
