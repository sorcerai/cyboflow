/**
 * WorktreeManager.getBranchLandingState — "has this branch's work already landed
 * in main?", the git-side half of the session delivery probe.
 *
 * This drives a DESTRUCTIVE prompt: it is what tells the dismiss dialog to offer
 * Mark complete (which preserves the session's findings) instead of dismissing
 * outright. So each real landing shape gets a case, because each one leaves a
 * different fingerprint in git:
 *
 *   fast-forward   → the branch's commits are literally in main
 *   cherry-pick    → equivalent patches, different SHAs (git cherry sees them)
 *   squash         → one unrelated commit, but identical trees
 *   still unmerged → none of the above
 *   empty session  → no commits of its own; must NOT report landed, or every
 *                    abandoned exploratory session grows an extra prompt
 *
 * Integration test — requires `git` on PATH.
