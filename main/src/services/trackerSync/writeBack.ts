/**
 * trackerSync/writeBack — the OUTBOUND detection half of the sync engine
 * (cyboflow -> tracker). Design: docs/proposals/tracker-sync-integration.md
 * ("Write-back & sub-issue mirroring" + "Durability & failure semantics" #1).
 *
 * This module makes ZERO network calls. It subscribes to the entity-change
 * broadcast (`taskChangeEvents` on TASK_ALL_CHANNEL, emitted by
 * TaskChangeRouter after every committed entity write) and translates the
 * changes that matter into durable `tracker_outbox` rows. outboxWorker.ts is
 * the only thing that talks to a provider — so every remote write has a
 * durable local record BEFORE it is attempted, which is what makes echo
 * suppression and crash recovery possible.
 *
 * MANUAL DELAYS, OFF DECLINES. An enqueue is a durable statement of INTENT, and
 * 'manual' means "hold this direction until the user asks", not "throw the
 * intent away" — so `auto`/`manual` gate the DRAIN (outboxWorker's
 * `allowedKinds`, chosen by trackerSyncService.runPass) and this module records
 * those intents unconditionally. A connection whose status sync is manual still
 * accumulates its stage writes and emits them, in order, on the next "Sync now".
 *
 * `'off'` — which only the two migration-112 modes have — is the ONE exception,
 * and it gates HERE, at the enqueue (invariant 5 of
 * docs/proposals/tracker-field-writeback.md). A row whose direction is off is
 * not delayed, it is UNDRAINABLE: `claimNextPending` never claims its kind, not
 * even under "Sync now", while `collectOutboxBlockers` is kind-agnostic and
 * halts the inbound batch at that issue on every pass. So an off direction
 * declines the intent outright rather than queueing a permanent inbound stall.
 * The other flag still read here is `mirror_subissues`, which is a scope choice
 * ("do sub-issues exist at all"), not a cadence.
 *
 * Six write-back triggers. All but the fourth need "the entity is linked AND its
 * connection is active"; the fourth is the only one that fires for an UNLINKED
 * entity:
 *
 *   1. STAGE MOVES. The entity's stage maps to a write-back group
 *      ('started' / 'completed' / 'cancelled' — `Ready for development`
 *      deliberately maps to nothing: readiness is not started). A group that
 *      differs from the last group we wrote (stamped on the link's baseline by
 *      the worker) enqueues an `update_state`.
 *   2. DECOMPOSITION. A linked idea that just picked up its `decomposed_at`
 *      retire stamp writes 'started' to the origin issue, and — when the
 *      connection has `mirror_subissues = 1` — enqueues one `create_sub_issue`
 *      per minted task that has no link yet.
 *   3. PARENT ROLLUP. A mirrored task reaching a terminal stage — Done OR
 *      Won't do — checks its siblings; once every mirrored child of the same
 *      parent issue is terminal, a `close_parent` is enqueued for the parent
 *      issue, 'completed' unless every child was abandoned, in which case the
 *      parent is cancelled (an idempotent no-op where Linear's native
 *      auto-close already fired; the sole mechanism for Plane).
 *   4. IDEA PUSH. An idea CREATED locally in a connected project enqueues a
 *      `create_issue` — a top-level issue in the connection's source container.
 *      Three skips keep it from filing an issue for something that already has
 *      one: a provider-authored create (the inbound import's own event), an
 *      idea that already carries a link for that provider, and a body carrying
 *      the tracker-import provenance marker (the unattributed-event backstop).
 *   5. CONTENT. A linked entity whose title / description / priority / category
 *      now DIFFERS from the link's baseline enqueues an `update_content`. Its
 *      payload is EMPTY — the drain composes from the entity as it stands then,
 *      the `create_issue` precedent — so a burst of edits collapses into one
 *      write. Gated on `content_sync_mode !== 'off'`.
 *   6. ARCHIVE. A linked entity picking up an `archived_at` stamp enqueues an
 *      `archive_issue` — the remote twin is trashed/archived, NEVER deleted.
 *      Gated on `archive_sync_mode !== 'off'` and on the provider having an
 *      archive endpoint at all. The mirror image, an UNARCHIVE, writes nothing
 *      remotely and only clears the idempotence stamp.
 *
 * TRIGGERS 5 AND 6 ARE PER-LINK, and deliberately do not settle for the FIRST
 * active provider link the way the older three do. An idea pushed to two
 * trackers must get two independent decisions — different modes, different
 * mappings, different baselines — so they enumerate every link through
 * {@link resolveAllLinked}. The three older triggers keep the single-link
 * behavior they have always had; widening them is a separate change with its own
 * dedupe and supersession consequences (recorded as a follow-up in the plan).
 *
 * TWO GUARDS ON EVERY NEW TRIGGER, and neither alone is sufficient. The ACTOR
 * FILTER skips the inbound half's own writes (every inbound apply runs with
 * `actor: connection.provider`), which is precise but optional on the event; the
 * BASELINE DIFF is the correctness backstop for an unattributed event, and is
 * what makes a replayed event a no-op.
 *
 * Every enqueue is DEDUPED against the connection's unresolved outbox rows, so
 * a burst of events (or a replayed one) can never queue the same remote write
 * twice. Combined with the baseline's last-written-group stamp, a stage that
 * flaps back and forth still produces exactly the writes the tracker needs.
 *
 * All tracker-table access goes through store.ts; the only direct SQL here is
 * against the native entity tables (`tasks`), which store.ts does not own.

 * FOUR REASONS TO SKIP, and each one covers a case the others cannot:
 *   1. PROVIDER ECHO — `actor` is 'linear'/'plane', so this create IS an
 *      inbound import. Precise, but `actor` is optional on the event.
 *   2. ALREADY LINKED — the idea already has a link for this connection's
 *      provider (a Reconcile-step link, a previous push that landed). Whatever
 *      created it, it is already represented in that tracker.
 *   3. IMPORT PROVENANCE — the body carries the import marker. The backstop
 *      under (1) for an unattributed event.
 *   4. AN EXPERIMENT SANDBOX ROW — an A/B sandbox idea is a local artifact of a
 *      comparison run, not a piece of work anyone tracks, and filing one into a
 *      shared workspace is noise nobody asked for.
 *
 * Plus the ordinary dedupe: an unresolved `create_issue` already queued for
 * this idea means a replayed event adds nothing.
 *
 * A FIFTH SKIP IS PER-CONNECTION: `push_target = 0`. Multi-project mapping
 * (design doc "Multi-project mapping (rev 4)") gives one cyboflow project N
 * sibling connection rows — one per mapped tracker group, all on the same
 * workspace — and exactly one of them per provider is the push target. Without
 * the flag every sibling would enqueue its own `create_issue` and one new idea
 * would file N identical issues remotely. The ALREADY-LINKED skip cannot cover
 * this: at enqueue time the idea carries no link for the provider yet, so every
 * sibling reads it as unrepresented.
 *
 * `mirror_subissues` is deliberately NOT consulted — it scopes the DECOMPOSITION
 * fan-out (whether an idea's tasks become children), which is a different
 * question from whether the idea itself is represented at all.

 *    not become a three-way diff must not become a remote write either.

 *    local-space comparison would read "P3 here, P2 there" on an entity nobody

 * "take theirs". The next inbound pass overlays a real snapshot, and the edit
 * after that triggers normally. Without this, the first event on every
 * pre-feature link would push its local priority into the tracker.
 *
 * THE MAPPINGS ARE RESOLVED WITHOUT A LIVE OPTION LIST, because this module
 * makes no network calls: the seed's canonical tokens plus the connection's
 * persisted overlay. That is the same "stored overlay, defensively parsed"
 * reading `summarizeConnection` takes of the state mapping, and it is safe
 * BECAUSE THIS IS ONLY A TRIGGER — the drain re-resolves against the provider's
 * live vocabulary and composes the actual patch from that, dropping any field
 * the live list can no longer express. The worst a stale token here can do is
 * enqueue a row the drain then settles with nothing to send.
