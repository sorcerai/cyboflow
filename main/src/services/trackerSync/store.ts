/**
 * trackerSync/store — the typed data-access layer over migration 093's four
 * tables (tracker_connections, entity_external_links, tracker_outbox,
 * tracker_conflicts). Design: docs/proposals/tracker-sync-integration.md
 * ("Data model" + "Durability & failure semantics").
 *
 * Every function takes a real better-sqlite3 `Database.Database` as its
 * first argument (no class, mirroring main/src/orchestrator/taskListing.ts /
 * main/src/services/cyboflow/transitions.ts) so it can be unit-tested against
 * a temp-file DB with zero mocking. Everything else in the sync engine (the
 * outbox worker, the poller, the conflict machinery, the wizard's tRPC
 * handlers) builds on this module — it owns 100% of the SQL for these four
 * tables so no other file should reach for `db.prepare` against them
 * directly.
 *
 * Timestamps are always `datetime('now')` (UTC 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'), same
 * as the migration's column defaults, so string comparisons (claimNextPending's
 * `next_attempt_at <= now`) stay consistent whether a row's timestamp came
 * from the schema default or a store write.
 *
 * Grouped into four sections mirroring the four tables:
 *   - Connections: insertConnection / getConnection / listConnections /
 *     listConnectionsByIdentity / updateConnectionSettings /
 *     connectionMatchesIdentity / findDisconnectedConnection /
 *     storedSourceContainerId / reactivateConnection / advanceCursor /
 *     storeSecret / readSecret / clearSecret.
 *   - Links: upsertLink / getLinkByEntity / getLinkById / getLinkByExternal /
 *     findSiblingLinkForExternal / listLinks / updateBaseline / markOrphaned /
 *     listLinksByParentExternal / listActiveLinksWithoutEntity /
 *     hasActiveLinkedDescendant.
 *   - Outbox: enqueueOutbox / supersedeQueuedStateWrites / claimNextPending /
 *     resolveOutbox / listUnresolvedOutbox / findOutboxByClientKey /
 *     requeueInFlightAsAmbiguous.
 *   - Conflicts: insertConflict / getConflict / listOpenConflicts /
 *     resolveConflict / hasOpenConflictForLink.

 * IDENTITY IS `(project_id, provider, workspace_id, base_url)` — "the same

 * `workspace_id` is the honest key for the first three because it is what the
 * connect flow persists from the LIVE `validateCredentials()` probe (Linear's
 * organization id, Plane's workspace slug), NOT anything the user typed: it
 * survives exactly the event that makes this lookup necessary, a credential
 * rotation. The API key changes, the workspace does not.
 *
 * `base_url` IS PART OF THE KEY because a Plane workspace slug is unique only
 * WITHIN one deployment: two self-hosted instances can each have an `acme`.
 * Reviving across them would rewrite `base_url` while KEEPING every retained
 * link, so write-back would target external ids belonging to the other
 * instance, and the deletion sweep would read that instance's 404s as remote
 * deletions and archive live local entities. A differing base URL therefore
 * mints a NEW connection; the old row keeps its links, harmlessly, since it
 * stays `disconnected` and nothing reads a retired row's links.
 *
 * Comparison is on the NORMALIZED value ({@link normalizeBaseUrl}), which is
 * why the filter runs in JS rather than in the WHERE clause: sqlite cannot
 * canonicalize a URL, and matching the stored string verbatim would fork the
 * identity on a trailing slash.
 *
 * `sourceContainerId` JOINED THE KEY with multi-project mapping (design doc
 * "Multi-project mapping (rev 4)"): one workspace now legitimately owns SEVERAL
 * retired rows in one project — one per mapped tracker group — and they differ
 * in nothing but their source. Without this, re-connecting one group would
 * revive whichever sibling was touched last and rewrite it onto the new source,
 * stranding that sibling's links on a row now pointing somewhere else. The
 * container is compared, not the whole selection, because it is the level a
 * mapping is minted at; re-picking a NARROW under the same container is still
 * the same mapping and still revives (a narrowed scope cannot strand a link —
 * the cursor reset re-fetches it and the deletion sweep's point lookup
 * distinguishes out-of-scope from deleted).
 *
 * Only `disconnected` rows are candidates. An active or paused connection is
 * still the project's live connection for that workspace, and silently
 * repointing it from a wizard run would move someone else's links. A stored
 * NULL `workspace_id` never matches either (SQL's NULL comparison), which is
 * deliberate rather than incidental: a row whose identity we never learned
 * cannot be claimed BY identity.
 *
 * Most recently updated first, so a workspace connected and retired more than
 * once revives the life whose links are freshest.

 * never in flight at once — but they still land out of ORDER when the older one
 * is carrying a backoff: 'started' fails and waits two minutes, 'completed' is
 * enqueued and drains immediately, then the backoff expires and 'started' goes

 * check the drain can make about "is something newer still queued". The only
 * moment both rows are knowable is when the newer one is written, which is
 * here.
 *
 * SCOPE, and what each exclusion buys:
 *   - `pending` ONLY. An `in_flight` row has a request out that no local write
 *     can recall, and settling it would be a lie about an outcome we do not
 *     know; it needs no handling anyway, since the claim is serial — the newer
 *     row is claimed only after it finishes, so the newer value lands last. An
 *     `ambiguous` state write is returned to `pending` by the reconcile and then
 *     drained in id order ahead of the newer row, which is again the right
 *     order.
 *   - `id < newRowId`, so this only ever settles rows the caller's own insert
 *     supersedes.
 *   - `kinds` is a SET, not the caller's own kind, because supersession is
 *     about what a write SAYS rather than which code path enqueued it: see
 *     {@link SUPERSEDING_KINDS} in outboxWorker for the table, and its header

 * re-append it (invariant 4 of docs/proposals/tracker-field-writeback.md) or
 * `findIssueByClientKey`'s absence proof stops holding for that link. The
 * marker's key is not on the link and is stripped from every description the
 * adapters return, so the create row that minted it is the only durable record
 * of it. Outbox rows are never pruned, so a long-settled create still answers.

 * carries the LATEST create's marker.
