/**
 * runClaudeSdkSessionPreflights — the SHARED fail-closed pre-flight ladder every
 * SDK-PINNED session door must clear BEFORE anything is provisioned.
 *
 * Extracted from the two hand-maintained copies it used to live in — the design
 * branch of `sessions:create-quick` (main/src/ipc/session.ts) and
 * `createDesignSession` (main/src/index.ts, the planner's design-mode fork) —
 * and now also serves the open-idea-session door
 * (main/src/services/openIdeaSessionCore.ts). A third hand-kept copy is exactly
 * how these ladders drift.
 *
 * The three rungs, IN ORDER (the order is load-bearing — the detection probe
 * would otherwise report a perfectly healthy account the user disabled):
 *   1. the Claude provider is switched on at all (Settings → Integrations);
 *   2. Claude credentials/binary detect (same helpers + state mapping as
 *      onboarding's `computeState`, so "available" means one thing everywhere);
 *   3. the global interactivePtyOnly lock is OFF — it forces every session onto
 *      the PTY substrate, which no SDK-pinned door can accept. (Demo mode's
 *      forced 'sdk' pin is COMPATIBLE with an SDK pin and is deliberately not
 *      checked.)
 *
 * Returns a structured `reason` rather than a message: each door keeps its OWN
 * user-facing wording ("Design sessions require…" vs "Idea sessions require…"),
 * so extracting the probe changed no string anywhere.
