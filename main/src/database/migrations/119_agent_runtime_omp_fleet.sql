-- Migration 119: admit 'omp-fleet' on sessions.agent_runtime and
-- workflow_runs.agent_runtime (OMP Phase 4, the fleet-supervisor runtime).
--
-- NUMBERED 119. Authored as 105, renumbered to 107 when main shipped its own
-- 105/106 — and renumbered AGAIN to 119 on the 0.2.6 rebase because main had
-- by then taken 107_bootstrap_proof through 118_tracker_content_archive_modes.
-- The ledger is keyed by FILENAME: a dev install that applied the old 105 or
-- 107 name applies this one again, which is harmless — the sequence is
-- idempotent, and test (h) pins that.
--
-- WHY A NEW FILE RATHER THAN AN EDIT TO 103. The migration ledger is keyed by
-- FILENAME and applies each .sql exactly once, so widening 103's CHECK list in
-- place would land only on fresh installs and silently never re-apply on an
-- already-migrated DB — the 062_approve_ideas_atype lesson 103's own header
-- records. Every install that already shipped 0.2.3 has 103 marked applied.
--
-- WHY NOT A CREATE-NEW/COPY/DROP/RENAME REBUILD OF `sessions`. 103 spells out
-- the hazard and it applies verbatim here: `sessions` is Crystal-legacy, ~40
-- columns accreted through ALTER TABLE, several of them added imperatively by
-- database.ts rather than by any .sql (`status_message` is the live example),
-- so "a hardcoded CREATE TABLE would silently drop any column a given install
-- has but this file does not list". It would also have to restate 103's own
-- widened CHECK lists from memory, and getting that wrong would UN-widen
-- 'omp-sdk'/'omp-pty' on the very installs that use them.
--
-- So this file reuses 103's shape-agnostic recipe: the constraint lives in a
-- column-level CHECK on a column that is in no index, no trigger, no view and
-- no other CHECK, so SQLite can DROP the column and re-ADD it with the widened
-- CHECK. It names only the column being widened, leaves every other column,
-- index and foreign key untouched, and needs no FK re-pointing. Values are
-- parked in a temp column across the drop. The sequence is idempotent, so a
-- re-run after a cleared ledger marker is harmless.
--
-- The widened sets deliberately differ per table, exactly as 103's do:
--   sessions      + 'omp-fleet'  — the fleet supervisor is a session runtime.
--   workflow_runs + 'omp-fleet'  — parity with the declared contract:
--                                  WORKFLOW_RUN_STORABLE_RUNTIMES
--                                  (shared/types/agentRuntime.ts) lists
--                                  'omp-fleet' as storable, so the column's
--                                  CHECK must admit every value that constant
--                                  permits or the type and the schema disagree.
--                                  NOTE: no writer emits it TODAY. The
--                                  quick-session sentinel does not carry the
--                                  session's resolved runtime — workflowRegistry
--                                  derives its stamp from `ompSdkRequested` and
--                                  writes 'omp-sdk' for a fleet session
--                                  (workflowRegistry.ts, createRun). This
--                                  widening is therefore forward-looking: it
--                                  keeps a future stamp from failing the CHECK
--                                  at write time, and costs nothing meanwhile.
--                                  Storable, never launchable
--                                  (WORKFLOW_LAUNCHABLE_RUNTIMES still excludes
--                                  it — a fleet supervisor has no per-step event
--                                  stream).
-- workflow_variants and agent_invocations are deliberately NOT widened: a
-- variant resolves to a workflow-launchable runtime, and an invocation row
-- records a per-step agent turn. Neither can ever be a fleet supervisor.
--
-- No `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF` marker: unlike 103 this file drops no table, so
-- there is nothing for a cascade or an orphan row to abort. The runner's
-- wrapping transaction is sufficient.
