-- Migration 050: workflow A/B testing — pairwise experiment comparison (slice C).
-- One pairwise-verdict row per side-by-side experiment (v1: exactly 2 arms => 1
-- comparison). The row is SELF-CONTAINED: both arms' frozen diffs + seed context
-- live on it so the pairwise judge survives worktree teardown and does not depend
-- on per-arm run_evals rows (which may be absent when eval is globally off). This
-- mirrors run_evals.diff_text's "freeze the diff at trigger" rationale.
--
-- run_id_a = the run tagged experiment_arm='A'; run_id_b = the run tagged 'B'
-- (arm identity comes from mig 048's workflow_runs.experiment_arm, NOT from
-- lexicographic ordering). Dedup + crash-safety via INSERT OR IGNORE on
-- UNIQUE(experiment_id). All FKs ON DELETE CASCADE (run/experiment deletion drops
-- the comparison; retention caveat documented in the plan Risks).
--
-- This migration does NOT touch workflow_runs (mig 048 owns experiment_id/
-- experiment_arm/variant_id/variant_label). Runs inside runFileBasedMigrations'
-- transaction wrapper (no explicit BEGIN/COMMIT). PRAGMA foreign_keys is OFF
-- during migration (database.ts), so the FKs below are recorded, not enforced now.
--
-- decision_review_item_id is written by THIS slice (the pairwise worker mints a
-- blocking kind='decision' review item) and read/resolved by slice B's
-- experiments.decide — the interface seam between slices for closing out the
-- human decision.
--
-- ⚠️ MIGRATION-NUMBER COLLISION: numbers 043/044/045 were previously claimed by
-- sibling branches. The ledger is filename-keyed; whichever lands second must
-- renumber. The integrator MUST verify no other 050_*.sql exists at merge time.
