/**
 * Content-Security-Policy for the PACKAGED renderer.
 *
 * The packaged app loads `frontend/dist/index.html` over `file://`, so there is
 * no response header to attach a policy to — a `<meta http-equiv>` baked into
 * the BUILT html is the only mechanism. It is injected at build time rather
 * than written into `index.html` by hand so that dev is completely untouched:
 * Vite's HMR client and react-refresh preamble are inline scripts injected per
 * request, which no static hash list could ever cover.
 *
 * `script-src` carries HASHES of the two inline theme scripts in index.html
 * instead of `'unsafe-inline'`. That is the directive that matters: this whole
 * policy exists so that markup injected into the renderer (a session name, a
 * rendered diff, agent-authored markdown) cannot execute and reach the IPC
 * bridge. `'unsafe-inline'` would give that back, and adding hashes makes
 * browsers ignore any `'unsafe-inline'` in the same directive anyway.
 *
 * Per-directive notes:
 *   script-src   'self' + inline hashes + jsdelivr (see MONACO_CDN below). NO
 *                'unsafe-eval' — nothing in the bundle was found to need it.
 *   style-src    'unsafe-inline' is required: Monaco, xterm and react-remark all
 *                inject <style> elements at runtime. Accepted for v1.
 *   font-src     @fontsource woff2 ship in the bundle ('self'); `data:` covers
 *                Monaco's inlined codicon font.
 *   img-src      artifact screenshots arrive over IPC as base64 `data:` URLs
 *                (see electron.d.ts artifacts:*), and log/file exports build
 *                `blob:` object URLs.
 *   frame-src    the artifact canvases: a design-prototype OOPIF on
 *                `http://127.0.0.1:<leased port>` and a live-canvas embed on
 *                `http://localhost:<port>`, both on ports assigned at runtime.
 *                `about:srcdoc` static-mockup frames are not governed by
 *                frame-src (they inherit the embedder's policy).
 *   connect-src  the renderer makes NO direct network calls — Sentry runs
 *                through @sentry/electron/renderer (IPC to main) and Aptabase
 *                is main-process only. jsdelivr is listed for the Monaco
 *                loader's own fetches.
 *   object-src / base-uri  hard 'none': no plugin content, and no <base> tag
 *                hijack of the relative asset paths this `base: './'` build uses.
 *
 * Deliberately ABSENT: `frame-ancestors`, `report-uri` and `sandbox` are ignored
 * when delivered via <meta>, so listing them would only produce console noise.
 */
/**
 * Monaco is loaded from jsdelivr at runtime: `@monaco-editor/react` defaults to
 * the CDN AMD loader and this project never calls `loader.config({ paths })`, so
 * the editor and diff panels fetch monaco-editor over the network even in the
 * packaged app. Allowing the host here keeps those panels working; it is also a
 * standing finding — self-hosting monaco would let this entry (and the
 * remote-script trust it implies) be deleted.
