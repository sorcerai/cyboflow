/**
 * insightsStore — Zustand slice feeding the Insights view (run statistics, token
 * usage rollups, review-queue summary, and code-quality buckets).
 *
 * GLOBAL singleton with an in-memory `projectFilter` (null = ALL projects). Like
 * {@link useLandingStore} and {@link useBacklogStore}, this store owns a
 * cross-project fan-out: when `projectFilter` is null it enumerates every
 * project and fans out the per-project queries, otherwise it queries the single
 * filtered project. Narrowing is a VIEW concern handled by `setProjectFilter`,
 * which re-runs the fetch fan-out.
 *
 * ## Data sources (all `cyboflow.insights.*` queries)
 *
 *   - workflowStats   — per-workflow run-outcome statistics (WorkflowRunStats[]).
 *   - workflowUsage   — per-workflow token/cost aggregate (WorkflowUsageStats[]).
 *   - dailyUsage      — per-(day, model) token buckets for the usage chart
 *                       (DailyModelUsagePoint[]); fetched once per fan-out in
 *                       PHASE 1 alongside the other top-level aggregates.
 *   - reviewSummary   — review-queue counters (ReviewItemSummary).
 *   - qualityFindings — kind='finding' review items flattened for the quality
 *                       columns (QualityFinding[]).
 *   - stepTokens      — per-workflow token attribution by step, keyed by
 *                       workflowId. Fetched per workflow, capped at the 6
 *                       most-recently-run workflows to bound fan-out.
 *   - usageTrend      — per-workflow time-bucketed sparkline points, keyed by
 *                       workflowId. Same 6-workflow cap.
 *   - revisionHistory — per-workflow per-spec_hash run stats (version history),
 *                       keyed by workflowId. Same 6-workflow cap / fan-out.
 *
 * `triageFindings` is the kind='finding', status='pending' subset of the review
 * inbox, fetched via `cyboflow.reviewItems.list` (NOT the insights router), each
 * mapped to a {@link TriageFinding} view-model that carries a derived
 * `triageState` ('untriaged' when `staged_at` is null, 'ready' once approved).
 * The `list` query is project-scoped (its input requires a positive projectId),
 * so the cross-project case enumerates projects and fans out per project — the
 * same shape landingStore uses for its review-item fan-out (the small loop is
 * duplicated here deliberately rather than importing landingStore internals).
 *
 * ## Idempotency + live refresh (mirrors reviewQueueStore / backlogStore)
 *
 * `init()` is guarded by a closure-private `initialized` boolean: the first call
 * fetches + subscribes; later calls are no-ops. AFTER the first fetch resolves,
 * `init()` wires the three GLOBAL lifecycle subscriptions activeRunsStore/
 * landingStore also use (`events.onRunStatusChanged` / `onApprovalCreated` /
 * `onApprovalDecided`) — each signals run-lifecycle or review-item activity that
 * can change any insights aggregate — PLUS a per-project
 * `reviewItems.onReviewItemChanged` subscription (the landingStore pattern,
 * re-wired when the project set changes) so a same-session/Review-Queue
 * Dismiss/re-tag/select reconciles BOTH the rows and the findings-scoped counter
 * strip (none of the three lifecycle signals fire on a ReviewItemRouter write).
 * On any of those events we DEBOUNCE for 2s, then `refresh()`. The unsubscribe
 * handles live in MODULE scope (the closure), so `init()` cannot double-subscribe.
 *
 * ## Stale-on-error + non-flashing refresh
 *
 * `loading` is set true ONLY on the first init (`!initialized`) so live refreshes
 * never flash the UI. Each query is caught independently: the first failure sets
 * `error` to its message; successful queries still commit, and a failed query
 * keeps the PREVIOUS slice value (stale-not-cleared). This means a transient
 * backend hiccup degrades gracefully instead of blanking the dashboard.
 *
 * The subscription `onData` callbacks are typed by AppRouter inference (no local
 * payload interface, no `(evt: unknown)` — CLAUDE.md rule); the callbacks ignore
 * the payload entirely and only use the event as a debounce trigger.
