   *
   * `model`'s global rung is `config.defaultLaunchModel` — the user's global
   * launch model, NOT the legacy `config.defaultModel` (that one feeds the
   * assistant fallback and must never reach a launch; it is exactly what

   *
   * The workflow runtime default rides the resolver's SUBSTRATE rung, NOT its
   * `agentRuntime` rung — the same rung-ordering rule `handleQuickSession` and
   * the wizard follow. `substrate` resolves `stored ?? implied ?? global ??
   * floor`, so a stored substrate outranks the global one; `agentRuntime`
   * resolves `stored ?? global` with NO stored-substrate rung above it. Feeding
   * a synthesized runtime into that rung therefore produced a self-contradictory
   * pair from the opposite side: a `workflow:<id>` entry carrying only
   * `{ substrate: 'interactive' }` came back as `agentRuntime: 'claude-sdk'`
   * (synthetic global) + `substrate: 'interactive'` (stored), and `runtimeSeed`
   * below then seeded the picker to a runtime the launch would not use.
   *
   * The one thing that DOES belong on the `agentRuntime` rung is the user's
   * genuine global runtime (`config.defaultAgentRuntime`) — coerced for THIS
   * key's launch kind first: these seeds drive a WORKFLOW launch, so a global
   * `codex-pty` (quick-session-only) is dropped and the seed falls back to the
