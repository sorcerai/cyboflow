/**
 * VerifyHealthPanel — the phase-3 health surface on the Verify Queue
 * (docs/proposals/verification-setup-flow.md §6).
 *
 * Two tables, both LIVE rather than remembered:
 *
 *   - PROJECTS — whether each project has verification set up, and a launch for
 *     the flow that sets it up.
 *   - HOST — one row per capability the user can act on (browser driving, and
 *     the two macOS TCC grants), re-run on every panel open. Never a stored
 *     checkbox: a TCC grant rots silently on any app-path or version change
 *     while a remembered "configured" keeps claiming otherwise, which is the
 *     failure this replaces. Each row carries whatever remedy exists — an
 *     in-place install for chromium, the OS prompt or the right Settings pane
 *     for a grant.
 *
 * The per-modality OUTCOMES block — runbook state, attempts, pass rate, failure
 * histogram, median duration, capability suppressions, and the unattributed /
 * setup-proof counters — is deliberately not rendered here for now. It answered
 * a question ("how has verification been going?") that nobody was asking of a
 * panel they open to find out whether verification WORKS, and on a project with
 * a proven runbook and no lane traffic yet it was four em-dashes and a number
 * about the budget.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP while it is gone: the project row reads `set up` when ANY modality
 * is proven, so a project with `web` proven and `native-screen` not shows no
 * sign that native-screen checks are silently skipping. `verificationRequests
 * .health` still serves all of it — this is a rendering decision, not a
 * teardown — so restoring the block is a UI change alone.
