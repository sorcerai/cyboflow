/**
 * TrackerWizardModal — the six-step connect wizard for a Linear/Plane/Dart
 * tracker connection (Connect · Map · Tasks · States · Reconcile · Review).
 *
 * Rendered as a `size="full"` Modal nested inside the Settings modal (the
 * WorkflowEditorModal pattern); Modal's cross-portal guards make the nesting
 * safe. State is flat local `useState` — this is a self-contained flow whose
 * values are handed to `cyboflow.tracker.connect` and then forgotten, so a
 * store would only add ceremony.
 *
 * ONE PASS MINTS N CONNECTIONS. The Map step maps tracker groups (Linear
 * projects + whole teams, Plane projects, Dart spaces) N:1 onto cyboflow
 * projects, and each mapping becomes its own `tracker_connections` row — so
 * everything downstream of Map is keyed by group: issues per group, one state
 * table per distinct `stateScopeKey`, one reconcile preview per distinct target
 * project, and one sequential `connect` call per mapping.
 *
 * Data flow, one probe per forward step (each is a MUTATION: every call carries
 * the API key and hits the provider live, so nothing here may be cached):
 *
 *   Step 0  wizardValidate   -> the "Authorized as …" identity card
 *   Step 1  wizardGroups     -> the mappable groups (+ a local project list)
 *   Step 2  wizardIssues ×N  -> the issue set the three modes filter, per group
 *   Step 3  wizardStates ×N  -> one mapping table per distinct state scope
 *   Step 4  reconcilePreview ×N -> pre-existing backlog rows, per target project
 *   Step 5  connect ×N       -> persists each mapping, then the parent refreshes
 *
 * Moving BACK never re-fetches; changing the mappings (or the Step-2 selection)
 * invalidates exactly the downstream steps that depend on it.
 *
 * The API key lives in this component's state and leaves only inside the
 * `credentials` field of the calls above — nothing ever reads it back.
 *
 * ADD-MAPPING MODE (`sourceConnection` set). Re-entered from the connected
 * view to manage an authorization that already exists, so Step 0 is not merely
 * pre-answered — it is GONE: the wizard opens on Map, the rail carries five
 * steps, Back from Map has nowhere to go, and nothing ever asks for the key
 * again. Every probe names the connection (`{ connectionId }`) instead of
 * carrying credentials, `connect` passes `sourceConnectionId`, and main
 * resolves the stored key on its side — so in this mode nothing key-shaped
 * crosses IPC at all.
 *
 * Its Map step is a MAPPING EDITOR in two halves. The connection's live
 * siblings are listed first, each with an Unlink that STAGES a disconnect
 * locally; below them, only the groups no kept sibling covers are offered a
 * project select — so a scope is either linked or mappable, never both, and
 * moving one is unlink-then-map rather than a second row on the same scope.
 *
 * Everything sibling-derived reads PAST a staged unlink (the push target it
 * holds, the container it covers), because Submit disconnects before it
 * connects; and a run that only unlinks skips Tasks/States/Reconcile entirely,
 * since those steps describe mapped groups it does not have.
