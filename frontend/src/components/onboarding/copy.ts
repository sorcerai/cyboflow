/**
 * Onboarding copy-of-record — strings & small data arrays shared by the modal
 * card, coachmark, and step bodies. Copy is transcribed from the design packet's
 * `Onboarding Carousel.dc.html` (the copy-of-record where it drifts from the
 * README), with the two deliberate deviations noted at their call sites:
 *   - step 1 drops the "Max plan" tier claim (main/ cannot introspect billing;
 *     see shared/types/onboarding.ts).
 *   - the rail-map step adds the Verify Queue row (six rows, not the
 *     prototype's five).
 * The wizard-Configure pointer steps (6-8) are a post-design addition with no
 * packet counterpart; their copy lives in Coachmark.tsx alongside the other
 * coach bodies.
