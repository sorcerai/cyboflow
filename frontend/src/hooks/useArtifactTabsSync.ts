/**
 * useArtifactTabsSync — keeps a session's center-pane artifact tabs in sync with
 * its live artifacts list.
 *
 * Shared by RunCenterPane (flow runs, keyed by the active run's parent session)
 * and QuickSessionCenterPane (quick sessions). Both hosts share ONE
 * centerPaneStore bucket per session key, so both feed this hook the SAME
 * SESSION-scoped list (`useSessionArtifactsList` — every run the session
 * hosted, chat sentinel + flow runs alike); a run-scoped list here would make
 * the prune effect below close the other host's still-valid tabs on every
 * RunCenterPane ↔ QuickSessionCenterPane switch. (RunCenterPane falls back to
 * the run-scoped list only for legacy parentless runs, whose run-id session
 * key is never shared with a quick pane.) This hook takes the resolved
 * `{ artifacts, loaded }` and:
 *   - registers a center-pane tab for every artifact, focusing only ones
 *     genuinely minted AFTER the pane's current session key started being
 *     watched (a fresh deliverable surfaces itself without yanking focus off
 *     pre-existing tabs on load/reopen);
 *   - prunes any artifact tab whose backing row vanished from the live list
 *     (so a pruned/deleted artifact never strands a tab on a perpetual
 *     "Loading…" state).

  // surfaces itself). The pre-existing set surfaced on first load must NOT yank
  // the user off the Flow tab.
  //
  // The DB `is_new` flag CANNOT be trusted for this: it is never written back to
  // 0, so on app refresh / fresh run re-select `artifacts.list` re-seeds every
  // prior artifact with isNew===true — which would steal focus on every reload
  // (exactly what this effect forbids). Instead we treat "new" as purely a
  // client-session notion: the FIRST sync for a session key marks every artifact
  // already present as already-seen (so it is opened WITHOUT stealing focus), and
  // only ids that appear in a LATER sync count as freshly minted and focus.
  //
  // The seed pass is GATED on `loaded`: useArtifactsList returns [] while its
  // seed query is in flight, so without the gate the "initial seed" would be
  // consumed on that empty pre-load list — then the real artifacts arrive in a
  // LATER sync and are mistaken for fresh mints, stealing focus to the last one
  // (the reopen-lands-on-an-artifact bug). Waiting for `loaded` means the initial
  // seed runs against the actual resolved list.
  //
  // centerPaneStore.openArtifactTab ALWAYS focuses the tab it opens/touches —
  // there is no no-focus "register" action. To open the initial seed without
  // stealing focus we capture the active tab id before the pass and restore it
  // afterwards (the Flow tab carries no `isNew`, so focusTab restoring it is a
  // no-op beyond setting activeTabId).

      // genuinely fresh THIS session: it is content-driven (only minted once it
      // has content), so we FLIP the center pane to it (focus:true) — the run just
