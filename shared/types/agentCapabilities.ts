/**
 * Per-runtime capability flags — the UI's launch-surface special cases as DATA.
 *
 * Every flag here replaces a scattered `=== 'codex-pty'` / `=== 'codex-exec'`
 * test that a launch surface used to hand-write. The point is not tidiness: a
 * third provider's runtimes would otherwise have to be discovered and patched
 * into each of those tests one site at a time, and a site that was missed fails
 * silently (an effort control rendered for a runtime that drops the flag, a
 * runtime seeded into a picker that cannot launch it).
 *
 * {@link RUNTIME_CAPABILITIES} is an EXHAUSTIVE `Record<AgentRuntime, …>`, so a
 * runtime added to the union is a compile error until it is described here.
 *
 * Scope discipline — a flag earns its place only if a shipping UI site tests
 * for it TODAY, and every value below is derived from that site's current
 * behavior, changing nothing. Two capabilities deliberately do NOT live here
 * because they are already expressed as data elsewhere, and a second copy could
 * drift from the first:
 *   - "may run a workflow"  → {@link WORKFLOW_LAUNCHABLE_RUNTIMES}
 *   - "may be stored on a workflow_runs row" → {@link WORKFLOW_RUN_STORABLE_RUNTIMES}
