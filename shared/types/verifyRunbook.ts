/**
 * The verification RUNBOOK contract — the committed, portable half of "how do
 * you stand this project up so it can be verified"
 * (docs/proposals/verification-setup-flow.md §5.2 seam 1 + §5.3).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. Two prior designs failed in opposite directions
 * (§1): the legacy waterfall required a MANUALLY authored `.cyboflow/verify.json`
 * nobody ever wrote, and the agent engine GUESSES the build/serve form per run
 * with no memory — and guessed wrong every single time (0-for-5 in production).
 * The runbook is the middle: derive once, PROVE by actually running it, persist,
 * reuse, invalidate on drift. The proof is the whole difference from
 * `verify.json`; a file that merely exists earns nothing (see
 * {@link VerifyRunbookV1} on why this file is only half the contract).
 *
 * THE SPLIT HALVES (§5.3 — the single most load-bearing rule here).
 * A runbook has a COMMITTED-PORTABLE half (this file's shape, living at
 * {@link VERIFY_RUNBOOK_RELATIVE_PATH} in the repo, travelling with the code
 * through every branch/clone/CI checkout) and a MACHINE-LOCAL half (a DB record
 * — see main/src/orchestrator/verify/runbookStore.ts — keyed by project +
 * modality and CAS-versioned against this half's content hash). The boundary is
 * not stylistic:
 *
 *   - Portable (HERE): commands as PARAMETERIZED LEVER TEMPLATES (`${PORT}`,
 *     never a resolved port), behaviors, modality declarations, readiness and
 *     attestation specs. Everything true of the PROJECT on any machine.
 *   - Machine-local (NOT here): host capabilities and resolved lever BINDINGS
 *     that are stable per host — binary paths, the data-dir lever's name, ABI
 *     facts — plus the proof provenance (§5.3) and the input/host fingerprints
 *     that demote the runbook when they drift.
 *   - REQUEST-SCOPED VALUES ARE IN NEITHER HALF. Ports and temp dirs are
 *     resolved by the scheduler per request, AFTER lease acquisition. A
 *     persisted port goes stale, diverges from the actually-held lease, or
 *     collides — root cause (b)/(e) of §1's failure table is precisely this
 *     mistake made informally. "A committed runbook derived on one machine must
 *     not encode another machine's lies."
 *
 * WHY `attestation` IS REQUIRED PER MODALITY (§7.1). The proposal's hardest
 * invariant is "no attestation channel ⇒ no `passed`, period" — a verification
 * that cannot prove the surface it drove IS this deliverable is not a
 * verification (the port pool is an in-process mutex that "guards the logical
 * slot, NOT the OS socket"; a warm cache or the user's own running app answers
 * happily). Making the field OPTIONAL here would push that failure to the far
 * end of a 10-minute deploy; making it REQUIRED means the setup flow must name
 * the channel while it is deriving the runbook, and the proof run then proves
 * the channel exists. That is exactly §7.1's "setup PROVES the channel exists as
 * part of the proof".
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it does not lint `build`/`serve` for
 * dependency-mutating commands. §5.3's "dependency mutation is runner-enforced,
 * not linted" is a v2 correction with teeth — a lint here cannot reach the OTHER
 * source of build steps (`VerificationTaskV1.build`, composed by an agent at
 * request time), so the guard that matters lives in the RUNNER, at execution
 * time, over every composed task regardless of origin. Duplicating a weaker
 * version of it here would only create the illusion of coverage.
 *
 * Purity invariant (mirrors ./visualVerification.ts, its sibling and the source
 * of the AttestationSpec / VerificationModality shapes re-used below): pure
 * types + consts + hand-rolled runtime guards. NO node / electron / IPC imports,
 * so the renderer (the phase-3 health panel, the setup wizard) and the main
 * process (the store, the runner) import the identical contract.
