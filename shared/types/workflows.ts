 * write via the `cyboflow_*` MCP tools, never `.soloflow/` files. `launch` is the
 * super-planner for a brand-new project — an in-depth interview produces a
 * project brief, the brief decomposes into an idea set, and the foundation
 * ideas become execution-ready epics and tasks; it ends at the approved
 * backlog and never materializes a sprint itself. The dropped `prune` flow
 * keeps its prose under `docs/workflows-future/` for a future rebuild. The
 * internal `__quick__` sentinel is NOT a member here — it is filtered out of the
 * picker and handled separately by the quick-session pipeline.
 *
 * THIS TUPLE IS AN APP-WIDE EXHAUSTIVE DISCRIMINANT, not a list. Adding a member
 * is a compile-time tripwire on every `Record<CyboflowWorkflowName, …>` — today
 * `WORKFLOW_DEFINITIONS` (below), `INITIAL_STEP_IDS`
 * (`main/src/orchestrator/stepTransitionBridge.ts`), and the renderer's
 * `WORKFLOW_LABEL` (`frontend/src/components/agentRail/ProposalCardBodies.tsx`) —
 * and it silently widens every derived surface that iterates it: the seeded
 * built-in rows (`buildBuiltInWorkflows`), the built-in agent catalogue
 * (`agentCatalogue.loadBuiltInAgents`), the reserved-name guard in
 * `WorkflowRegistry`, and the `TelemetryFlow` union. A new member therefore also
 * needs its flow `.md` + agent bundle on disk and a decision on the
 * code-review-eval auto-entry posture (`snapshotRunForEval`). See
 * `docs/proposals/verification-setup-flow.md` §5.1, which costs this out.
 *
 * ORDER MATTERS: `agentCatalogue.loadBuiltInAgents` walks this tuple and dedupes
 * bundled agent basenames FIRST-WINS, so `launch` — whose bundle copies several
 * planner/sprint agents verbatim (context/research/ui-prototype/architecture/
 * adversarial-review/epics/tasks) — must stay LAST so those originating
 * workflows stay the canonical `role` owner.
 *
 * A parallel sprint is a SINGLE session-hosted `sprint` run seeded with N task
 * ids: the sprint ORCHESTRATOR AGENT analyzes the task dependency DAG itself,
 * then fans out per-task subagents with bounded concurrency in the shared
 * session worktree. Per-task progress is tracked as "lanes" in the

  // verify-setup — the per-project visual-verification setup flow
  // (docs/proposals/verification-setup-flow.md §5): derive → prove → persist →
  // reuse. It exists because BOTH prior designs failed in opposite directions —
  // the legacy waterfall demanded a hand-authored `.cyboflow/verify.json` nobody
  // ever wrote, and the agent engine guesses the build/serve environment per run
  // with no memory and guessed wrong every single time (0-for-5 in production).
  // The middle is a runbook derived ONCE from evidence and then PROVED by an
  // actual run through the real verification path.
  //
  // Shape is Compound's `extract → approve-learnings → write-back → human-review`
  // template 1:1 — propose, gate, apply + commit, terminal merge gate — with the
  // proof step wedged between apply and gate, because "we wrote a config file" is
  // exactly the non-guarantee this flow exists to replace. FIVE steps in a single
  // 'Verify Setup' phase with exactly TWO human gates: `approve-runbook` (the
  // proposal, BEFORE anything touches the repo) and the terminal `human-review`
  // merge gate over the committed diff + the per-modality proof outcomes.
  //
  // Two properties that are load-bearing and easy to break:
  //  - It is EVAL-EXEMPT by name in snapshotRunForEval, exactly like compound
  //    (§5.1): its diff is a config file and a couple of isolation levers, not
  //    rubric material, and rubric-grading the setup flow would tax every project
  //    that dares to configure verification.
  //  - `prove` NEVER marks a runbook proven. It fires a `setup_proof` verification
  //    and awaits the verdict; the ENGINE marks (project, modality, hash) proven
  //    off a PASSING request with full §5.3 provenance. Proof-by-running is
  //    engine-enforced precisely so a flow cannot assert its own success.
