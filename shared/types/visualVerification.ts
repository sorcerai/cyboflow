/**
 * Pure shared seam for layered visual verification (see
 * docs/proposals/visual-verification-design.md). Sibling to ./substrate.ts and
 * ./executionModel.ts: both the main process (resolver, scheduler, backends,
 * judge, registry) and the renderer (verify panel, settings) import from here.
 *
 * This file is the ONE place the verification taxonomy, the backend id set, the
 * capability matrix, and the fall-forward chains are declared — a wrong matrix
 * entry silently mis-routes a request, so the table is small + reviewed
 * (4 backends × 5 types). Keep it free of Node.js / Electron / IPC / runtime
 * imports so it can be imported in any environment (it is pure types + consts).
 *
 * CONTRACT NOTES (single contract split across files — widen together):
 *  - The VerificationType union, the FALLBACK_CHAINS keys, and the BACKEND_CAPABILITIES
 *    columns are one taxonomy. If a new type is ever added, widen all three.
 *  - The VisualBackendId union and the BACKEND_CAPABILITIES rows / FALLBACK_CHAINS
 *    members are one backend set. If a new backend is ever added, widen both.
 *  - REQUEST_STATUS mirrors the CHECK domain on verification_requests.status in
 *    migration 055 (defined in P3) — a single contract split across TypeScript +
 *    SQL, exactly as the CliSubstrate / migration 013 pairing.
 *  - VerificationFailureClass / VerificationModality (added for
 *    docs/proposals/verification-setup-flow.md Phase 0/1) are their own
 *    single-contract pairings: failure_class/modality on verification_requests
 *    (migration 095, plain nullable TEXT — no SQL CHECK domain, unlike
 *    REQUEST_STATUS, since a stricter CHECK would reject a future-added member
 *    from an old binary's write) and VerifyCapabilityStore's ledger tables
 *    (main/src/orchestrator/verify/capabilityStore.ts). Widen all three together.

 * {@link VerificationReportV1.attestation}'s doc for that distinction).
 *
 * Kind → modality mapping (§7.1, §4 roster table):
 *   - `'http-endpoint'`   — `web`: the serve step injects a route that the
 *     driver GETs at `http://localhost:$VERIFY_PORT<urlPath>`; the response
 *     body must contain the per-request nonce the runner minted for this
 *     request. Requires a live, classic (non-attach) serve step.
 *   - `'dom-marker'`      — `web`: an element's text or a `data-*` attribute
 *     in the rendered DOM carries the nonce instead of a dedicated route —
 *     for a deliverable that cannot add a server-side endpoint.
 *   - `'cdp-token'`       — `cdp-app`: `Runtime.evaluate(expression)` over the
 *     CDP session must equal `expected`, an immutable build-stamped global
 *     the deliverable exposes. The ONLY channel that covers `serve.attach ===
 *     'cdp'` mode, where the driver never navigates (so there is no `goto` to
 *     check an HTTP status on) — it reads the ALREADY-RUNNING app's own
 *     identity instead.
 *   - `'window-identity'` — `native-screen`: the launched app named by `app`
 *     has an OS window whose title matches `titlePattern`. The WEAKEST channel
 *     (§7.1 says so explicitly — a window title is spoofable/coincidental in a
 *     way an in-page nonce or a CDP-evaluated token is not) and MUST be
 *     recorded as such on the verdict rather than treated as equal-strength
 *     evidence.
 *
 *     `app` is REQUIRED, and is not merely plumbing for peekaboo's `list
 *     windows --app <app>`: scoping the question to one application is what
 *     separates "the app we launched is showing this window" from "something
 *     on this machine has a window with a matching title", and the second is
 *     not an identity check at all.
 *   - `'file-identity'`   — the degenerate pre-live path (`target.htmlPath`):
 *     identity BY CONSTRUCTION, because the runner itself writes/owns the
 *     path being opened. No live process, no nonce, nothing to race.

 * How a TERMINAL verification failure is attributed (§3.1). The classifier is

 * absent), a bind-refused probe on the leased port against a pre-verified
 * squatter, instance-lock contention detected by the runner, or an attestation
 * channel that never came up while a squatter probe shows foreign occupancy.
 * Everything else — including every model-authored `build_failed` /
 * `launch_failed` without harness corroboration — is `'ambiguous'`, never
 * `'env'`, no matter how confidently the agent's own report reads.
 *
 * This asymmetry is load-bearing, not cosmetic: `mergeGateLaneAdvance.ts`
 * treats a terminal `'skipped'` status as an ADVANCE of the lane toward
 * `integrated` — the exact same treatment a PASS gets (see its R4 handling). If
 * a genuine deliverable regression were ever misclassified as `'env'` and
 * routed to `skipped`, the lane would ship broken code silently instead of
 * looping back to implement. So the failure mode of a false `'env'` is
 * dangerous (advances the lane); the failure mode of a false `'ambiguous'` is
 * merely annoying (stays blocking, exactly like today's undifferentiated
 * `'failed'`). When the evidence does not clearly say `'env'`, classify
 * `'ambiguous'` — never guess toward the dangerous side.
