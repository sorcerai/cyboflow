/**
 * Shared Approval types for the review-queue UI (review-queue-ui epic).
 *
 * These are the UI-facing wire types that flow from the tRPC
 * `cyboflow.approvals.listPending` query and the
 * `cyboflow.events.onApprovalCreated` subscription to the renderer's
 * `reviewQueueStore`.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *  - Pure type module: NO runtime imports.
 *  - Separate from `shared/types/approval.ts` (the transport-adapter contract
 *    for ApprovalRequest / ApprovalDecision).  These types are UI-stable; the
 *    transport types are substrate-internal.
 *  - Field shapes are wire-stable: changing them is a breaking change to the
 *    review-queue UI and every component that imports from this module.

   * The omp-sdk lane is the exception. OMP kills an extension handler at 30s,
