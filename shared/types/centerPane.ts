/**
 * Center-pane tab model — the tabbed running-session surface (design handoff
 * "Tabbed center pane").
 *
 * Per running session the center column holds a strip of tabs over a content
 * area, with a collapsible terminal dock pinned below. There are three tab kinds:
 *   - `flow`     — the pinned, non-closeable home tab (workflow graph / sprint
 *                  swimlanes). Exactly one per session.
 *   - `file`     — a file/diff opened from the File Explorer (closeable). Carries
 *                  the run worktree path + git status letter.
 *   - `artifact` — a run deliverable (idea spec, stories, screenshots, ui
 *                  prototype, …) rendered as a template or a live canvas.
 *
 * Tab state is per-session and IN-MEMORY only (a Zustand slice; no DB / no
 * localStorage). It persists across sequential runs within a session and resets
 * on app refresh. The durable source of truth for artifacts is the artifacts DB
 * table — closed artifact tabs are reopened from the right-rail Artifacts panel.

 * run must neither hijack it nor be hijacked by it (a local `decomposed-stories`
 * arriving in the session list would otherwise land on the same tab as the
